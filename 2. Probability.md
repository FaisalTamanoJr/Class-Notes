- Probability
	- Probability is an index which measures how likely an event caused by a statistical experiment will occur.
- Statistical Inference
	- Statistical inference is the process of using sample information to draw conclusions about the characteristics of a population being studied.
- Importance of probability and statistical inference
	- The study of probability and statistical inference aids in the translation of sample information into something conclusive or inconclusive about the scientific system being studied. The resulting conclusion from the statistical inference can assist an individual in their decision-making process.
	- It can allow us to quantify the confidence we have in our conclusions.
- Experiment
	- An experiment is a process which generates observations or measurements commonly referred to as raw data or information. In other words, experiments are used to collect raw data.
	- Conditions that indicate that the experiment is **random** or **chance process**
		1. All possible outcomes are known before the experiment is performed.
		2. No particular outcome can be predicted with certainty before conducting the experiment.
- Sample space
	- Terminologies
		- **Sample space (S)** is a list of all possible outcomes.
		- **Sample points (x)** are the elements of the sample space (a single outcome is a single sample point).
	- Ways of defining a sample space
		1. Listing/Roster method
			- Done by enumerating all the elements of the sample space.
		2. Defining property method
			- Done by selecting a property common to all sample points, then using that same property to define a sample space.
		3. Tree diagram
			- Done by using the tree structure to chronologically express the sequence of events of an experiment.
- Events
	- Definition
		- An event is a subset of a sample space.
	- Types
		- Simple event
			- An event consisting of only one outcome.
		- Compound event
			- An event consisting of more than one outcome. In addition, this type of event can be decomposed into simple events.
	- Operations
		- $A \cup B$
			- The set that includes all possibilities of only event $A$ happening, or only event $B$ happening, or both events at the same time. This operation is referred to as the **union** between $A$ and $B$.
			- Terms used to imply union of events:
				- either or
				- one or the other
				- at least one
				- one of the
				- a/an
		- $A \cap B$
			- The set containing the **intersection** of $A$ and $B$ consists of all possibilities of both the events happening at the same time.
			- Terms used to imply the intersection of events
				- both
				- neither nor
			- If two events cannot happen at the same time, they are said to be **mutually exclusive** or **disjoint** events.
		- $A’$
			- The **complement** of $A$ refers to the set of all possibilities where $A$ does not occur.
		- $S’$
			- The **complement** of the sample space is known as the **impossible event/empty set/null set**.
				- $S’=\phi$
				- $\phi \cup S = S$
