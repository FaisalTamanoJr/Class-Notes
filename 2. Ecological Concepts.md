- Ecology
	- The study of interactions between different organisms, and between organisms and their surroundings.
- Ecosystem
	- The organisms living in an area and the non-living features of their environment. It also includes the interactions that exist within.
	- They vary in complexity, not delineated by sharp boundaries, merge with one another.
	- Major components
		- Biotic
		- Abiotic
- Biosphere
	- The part of earth that supports life.
		- Top portion of Earth’s crust
		- Earth’s bodies of water
		- Earth’s atmosphere
- Ecology and life
	- Levels of ecological organization
		- Species
			- Refer to all organisms that can reproduce.
		- Populations
			- The organisms of the same species living in the same place and at the same time.
		- Community
			- Several interacting populations occupying the same habitat.
		- Ecosphere
			- The entirety of Earth’s ecosystems.
- Earth’s life support system
	- Atmosphere
		- Uses
			- Breathing
			- Ozone layer
		- Composition
			- The atmosphere is a thin layer of gases that surrounds the Earth. It is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 0.9% argon, and 0.03% carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of other gases.
	- Lithosphere
		- The lithosphere is divided into three principal regions: core, mantle, and the crust. The two principal divisions of Earth’s lithosphere are the continents and the ocean basins.
		- Inner core
			- Is beneficial due to the magnetic field it produces, which can help deflect solar flares from the sun. It also helps in providing direction.
	- Biosphere
		- A closed system.
		- All materials are repeatedly recycled.
		- Only one contribution from the outside, the Sun.
	- Hydrosphere
		- It is the water portion of Earth that covers nearly 71% of Earth’s surface.

- Biomes
	- A distinct ecological community of plants and animals living together in a particular climate.
	- Broad terrestrial regions of the biosphere.
	- Climate
		- The weather over the long term that determines the type of life forms in the biomes.
	- Precipitation and temperature
		- The most important climatic factors.
- Biotic Components
	- Divisions of biotic components
		- Producers
			- Plants (autotrophs)
		- Consumers
			- Organisms (heterotrophs)
			- Herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores.
			- Classification
				- Primary
				- Secondary
				- Tertiary
		- Decomposers
- Interactions among organisms
	- Predation
	- Commensalism
