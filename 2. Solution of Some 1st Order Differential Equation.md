- Variable Separable
	- General Form
		- $M(x,y)dx+N(x,y)dy=0$
		- The two functions must be products or quotients of x and y, meaning that they can be separated. Otherwise, they are not variable separable.
	- Solution
		- $A(x)B(y)dx+C(x)D(y)dy=0$
		- General Solution
			- $F(x,y)=c$
- DEs with Homogeneous Coefficient
	- Homogeneous Function
		1. A function is said to be homogeneous of degree $n$ if and only if
			- $f(tx,ty)=t^nf(x,y)$
			- You can draw out the original function multiplied by  $t^n$ when substituting $tx$ to $x$ and $ty$ to $y$ in the function.
		2. The DE $M(x,y)dx+N(x,y)dy=0$ is only homogeneous when both $M(x,y)$ and $N(x,y)$ are homogeneous, and are of the same degree.
			- Standard form
				- $M(x,y)dx+N(x,y)dy=0$
			- Solution
				- If M is simpler than N
					1. let: $x=vy$
					2. $x'=vy'+yv'$
				- If N is simpler than M
					1. let: $y=vx$
					2. $y’=vx’+xv’$
			- General Solution
				- $F(x,y)=c$
					- Substitution would reduce the resulting DE into a variable separable type.
