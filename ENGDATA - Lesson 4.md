- [[probability distribution|Probability distribution]]
	- Is a table or a function that helps in determining the probability of each value of the random variable.
	- Types
		- [[discrete probability distribution]]
			- Involves a discrete random variable.
		- [[continuous probability distribution]]
			- Involves a continuous random variable.
- [[Discrete probability distribution]]
	- Characteristics
		1. $f(x)>0 \begin{align} && \forall{x\text{ (for all x)}} \end{align}$
			- The probability of each outcome is greater than or equal to 0.
		2. $\sum f(x)=1$
			- The sum of the probability of all outcomes is equal to 1.
		3. $P(X=x)=f(x)$
			1. Refers to the value of the function when the random variable $X$ is equal to a specific value $x$
