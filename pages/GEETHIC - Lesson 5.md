# [[categorical imperative|Categorical imperative]]

[[Kant|Immanuel Kant]] put forward the most prominent [[deontology|deontological]] theory called the *categorical imperative*. Unlike the other deontological theories, it asserts that [[moral standards|moral laws]] should only come from reason and not from any external authority (e.g., God, and nature).

It claims that generous actions with moral worth are not prompted by natural inclinations. Moral principles would not be consistent if it was founded on human inclinations, desires, or nature—because these things vary for each person; thus, would entail that moral standards would also be different per individual. Moreover, the theory views morality as a necessity that does not require other things for it to exist; in other words, it is not *contingent*.

```ad-quote
*We cannot too much or too often repeat our warning against this lax and even mean habit of thought which seeks for its principle amongst empirical motives and laws; for human reason in its weariness is glad to rest on this pillow and in a dream of sweet illusions it substitutes for morality a bastard patched up from limbs of various derivation, which looks like anything one chooses to see in it; only not like a virtue to one who has once beheld her in her true form*
— Kant, 1965
```

Kant contends that our rational will (or reason) solely underlies morality, independent of empirical observation. Consequently, he claims that our moral knowledge comes before human experience, and as such, moral reasoning is based on reason alone—even without even the aid of human experience.

## The [[good will]]

Kant believes that morality is necessary, absolute, and universal; therefore, its value is not [[instrumental good|derived]] from nonmoral goods like happiness (it is [[intrinsic good|inherently valuable]]).

```ad-quote
*...this Good will should wholly lack power to accomplish its purpose, if with its greatest efforts it should yet achieve nothing, and there should remain only the Good Will,... then, like a jewel, it would still shine by its own light, as a thing which has its whole value in itself. Its usefulness or fruitfulness can neither add to nor take away anything from this value*
— Kant, 1965
```

For Kant, the highest good is one that is intrinsically valuable—which he referred to as *moral good*—as opposed to the derived *nonmoral good* found in [[utilitarianism]].

Besides this, he also claimed that *good will* is the only thing good in itself.[^will] For this reason, he argued that the only good actions are the ones performed with a good will: if a person does a generous action for a motive besides moral duty, they are acting with the wrong motive.

The idea that good will is the only thing good in itself implies that other virtues—such as happiness, knowledge, and power (nonmoral goods)—are only [[instrumental good|instrumental goods]], thereby having the potential to be evil when used by an *evil will*. As a result, only good will is essential in determining whether a particular action is morally valuable or not.

## Acting from duty

According to Kant, for an action to be good, it has to come with a good will; in other words, it is done for the right reason. This means that a *good person* is one whose actions are motivated by their duties or their respect for the moral law itself. Good people act *from duty* and not *in accord with duty*; they do not do good because it is convenient to do so, rather, they do it because it is their duty.
