# [[categorical imperative|Categorical imperative]]

[[Kant|Immanuel Kant]] put forward the most prominent [[deontology|deontological]] theory called the *categorical imperative*. Unlike the other deontological theories, it asserts that moral laws should only come from reason and not from any external authority (e.g., God, and nature).

It claims that generous actions with moral worth are not prompted by natural inclinations. Moral principles would not be consistent if it was founded on human inclinations, desires, or nature, because these things varies for each person—entailing that moral standards also vary for each person.
