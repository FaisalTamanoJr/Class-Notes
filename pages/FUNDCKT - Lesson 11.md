# Three-phase Circuits

A single-phase AC power system is composed of a generator connected to a load through wires (a transmission line).

A *polyphase* is a circuit/system which have the same frequency but different phases. An example would be a two-phase system; it can have two coils placed perpendicularly to each other so that the voltage generated by one lags the other by $90^{\circ}$. Another example would be a three phase system; it can have a generator with three sources that have the same amplitude and frequency, but it is out of phase with each other by $120^{\circ}$

Three reasons why three-phase systems are important:

1. **They are flexible and widely used:** Most electric power around the word is distributed and generated in three-phase systems with a frequency operating at 50 Hz. When other phase systems are needed, the three phase system can be altered to adjust to the requirements.
2. **Their instantaneous power can be constant:** This ensures that the power transmission is uniform and the machine vibrate less.
3. **They are economical:** They require less wires than single-phase systems for the same amount of power.

## Balanced Three-phase Voltages

Three-phase voltages are usually generated using three-phase AC generators (or alternators). The generator is comprised of the following parts:

1. rotating magnet (or *rotor*);
2. stationary winding (or *stator*), which surrounds the rotor; and
3. three separate windings (or coils) with terminals $a-a'$, $b-b'$, $c-c'$, which are $120^{\circ}$ apart around the stator.

The generator generate voltages when the rotor rotates and its magnetic field cuts the flux from the three coils. These voltages have equal magnitude but are out of phase by $120^{\circ}$. In addition, each phase can be a single-phase generator; hence, three-phase generators can provide power to both three-phase and single-phase loads.

Three-phase systems oftentimes are made up of three voltage sources connected to loads with 3-4 wires (or transmission lines). It is equivalent to three single-phase systems, and has voltage sources that are either wye-connected or delta-connected.

At the image above, particularly at (a), the voltages $\boldsymbol{V}_{an}$, $\boldsymbol{V}_{bn}$, and $\boldsymbol{V}_{cn}$ are called *phase voltages*. These are characterized as *balanced* only when they have the same amplitude and frequency, and are out of phase by $120^{\circ}$. As a result, balanced phase voltages have a total sum of 0.

> | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
> | $\boldsymbol{V}_{an}=V_{p}\angle0^{\circ}$      | $\boldsymbol{V}_{an}=V_{p}\angle0^{\circ}$      |

> | $\boldsymbol{V}_{cn}=V_{p}\angle120^{\circ}$    | $\boldsymbol{V}_{cn}=V_{p}\angle{-120^{\circ}}$ |

The positive sequence occurs when the rotor rotates counter-clockwise, while the negative sequence occurs when it rotates in a clockwise direction. The *phase sequence* describes the time order in which the voltage reaches their peak. It is important to know the phase sequence to determine the rotation direction of the motor connected to the power source.

Similar to three-phase voltages, three-phase load can also be either be wye-connected or delta-connected. If there are four wires instead of three, there will be a neutral line connected; however, this is impossible for a delta-connection.

The load is considered balanced when all phase impedances have equal magnitude and are in phase.

> - $\Delta-Y$ connection

> [!NOTE]
> Balanced delta-connected load is more common than wye-connected load because it is easier to add/remove a load to each phase of a delta-connected load. On the contrary, delta-connected sources are unpopular due to the circulating current that will result in the delta-mesh when the three-phase voltages are slightly unbalanced.
