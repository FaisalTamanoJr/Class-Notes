# Transient Response

## Capacitors

A [[capacitor]] is a passive [[electrical element|element]] that stores [[energy]] in its *electric field* using two conducting plates that are separated by an [[insulator]] (or [[dialectric]]). Specifically, voltage sources deposit their positive [[charge]] $q$ on one plate of a capacitor and their negative charge -$q$ on another plate.

The [[capacitance]] of a capacitor describes the ratio between the charge on one of its plates and the voltage difference of its two plates. The capacitance’s magnitude is denoted in farads ($F$).

The charge $q$ inside a capacitor is proportional to the applied [[voltage]] $v$:

$$q=Cv$$

> [!NOTE]
> $C$ pertains to the constant of proportionality or the capacitance.

### Capacitance and its physical dimensions

The relationship between the capacitance and its physical dimensions is illustrated in the following equation:

$$C=\frac{\epsilon A}{d}$$

Where:

- $A$ is the surface area of the plates
- $d$ is distance between the plates
- $\epsilon$ is the dialectric material’s [[permittivity]]

### Passive sign convention

The capacitor is being charged when the voltage and [[current]] have the same signs. Conversely, the capacitor is discharging when the product of the voltage and current is negative.

## Inductors

An [[inductor]] is a passive element that stores energy in its *magnetic field* using coils of conducting wire.

The voltage across the inductor is directly proportional to the time rate of change of the current when that current is allowed to pass through an inductor.

The inductor’s [[inductance]], measured in henry’s ($H$), refers to the property in which the inductor resists the change of current flowing through it:

$$v=L \frac{di}{dt}$$

> [!NOTE]
> L is the constant of proportionality or the inductance.

### Inductance and its physical dimensions

The relationship between the inductance and its physical dimensions is illustrated in the following equation:

$$L=\frac{N^2\mu A}{\ell}$$

Where:

- $N$ is the number of turns
- $\mu$ is the [[permeability]] of the core
- $A$ is the cross-sectional area
- $\ell$ is the length
