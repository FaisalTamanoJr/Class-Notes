# Basic Electronics

## Sources

1 . Lesson 1-BASIC ELECTRONICS (Lecture Slides)

## Introduction

[[Electronics]] deals with the control of free electrons and charge carriers that flow in vacuum, gas, and semiconductor materials.[^semiconductors]

## History of Electronics

The history of electronics is divided into two eras:

1. **Vacuum Tube Era -** the era which started with the invention of vacuum tubes at the first half of the twentieth century.
2. **Transistor Era -** the era which started with the invention of transistors at the latter half of the twentieth century.

### Vacuum Tube Era

#### 1883 - The Start of Electronics

- In **1883**, Thomas Edison discovered how electric currents were conducted in a vacuum.
	- This was groundbreaking because, in a vacuum, there are no gas molecules to ionize and conduct the electricity. However, it was discovered that sufficiently heating an electrode in a vacuum can liberate the electrons—through the generated kinetic energy—from the filament’s surface.[^electrode]
- Edison observed that the electric current flowed through the light bulb when he applied a positive voltage to the metal plate and filament, which were both enclosed inside a vacuum.
- The current was produced by the electron flow emitted by the hot filament. This phenomenon was referred to as the *Edison Effect*.

> [!TIP]- What is a Filament?
> A filament is a threadlike object surrounded by the metal plates in a light bulb.

#### 1895-1897 - The Discovery of Electrons

1. In **1895**, Hendrik Lorentz suggested the existence of electrons.
2. In **1897**, Joseph Thompson proved the existence of electrons.

#### 1904-1926 The Discovery of Various Types of Vacuum Tubes

1. In **1904**, John Fleming invented the *vacuum tube diode*.
	- Using the Edison Effect, John Fleming created a device which can rectify and detect radio signals.
	- Vacuum tubes enable the flow electric currents in vacuums with [[voltage]]-applied electrodes.
2. In **1906**, Dr. Lee de Forest invented the *vacuum tube triode*.
	- Forest developed a vacuum tube that can also amplify electric signals.
3. In **1919**, Walter Schottky invented the *vacuum tube tetrode*.
	- He created it because the inter-electrode capacitance from a triode would produce an undesired effect at high frequency operation.
4. In **1926**, Benjamin Tellegen invented the *vacuum tube pentode*.
	- He developed it to overcome the secondary emission effect that was present in a vacuum tube tetrode.
5. In **1948**, George Philbrick invented the *vacuum tube op-amp*.
	- This device was used in analog computers for mathematical operations.

> [!NOTE] Rectification
> [[Rectification]] refers to the process of converting an AC signal to a pulsating DC one.

### Transistor Era

> [!INFO] Transistors
> [[transistor|Transistors]] are devices which function like better vacuum tube triodes: they are smaller, consume less power, and lose less heat.

1. In **December 1947**, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain invented the *point-contact transistor*.
	- They invented a solid-state semiconductor device that can amplify electric signals.
2. In **January 1948**, William Shockley invented the *junction transistor*.
3. In **1959**, Jack Kilby and Dr. Robert Noyce invented the *Integrated Circuit (IC)*.
	- The device was a single semiconductor layer that combined transistors, diodes, resistors, and capacitors.
4. In **1963**, Fairchild invented the *IC op-amp*.
5. In **1971**, M.E. Hoff developed the *microprocessor*.
	- A microprocessor was an IC consisting of all the components of a computer’s Central Processing Unit (CPU).
