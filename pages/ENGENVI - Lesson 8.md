- [[noise pollution|Noise pollution]]
	- [[noise|Noise]]
		- Noise refers to unwanted or disturbing sound. It becomes unwanted when it interferes with normal activities (e.g., sleeping and conversations) or diminishes oneâ€™s quality of life.
	- It is more than just an annoyance and can lead to the following:
		- Lost productivity that may lead to economic losses.
		- Sleep disruption, affecting cognitive function and overall well-being.
		- Health issues
			- stress-elevated illnesses
			- elevated blood pressure
			- speech difficulty
			- hearing loss. ([[Noise Induced Hearing Loss]] \[NIHL\])
	- Sources
		- Transportation
			- Road traffic
			- Air traffic (from aircraft noise)
			- Rail traffic (from the train)
		- Industrial activities
			- Factories and manufacturing plants
			- Construction work
		- Recreational activities
			- Loud music
			- Power tools and lawn equipment
				- lawn mowers
				- leaf blowers
		- Natural sources
			- Thunderstorms
			- Animals and insects
	- Effects
		- Physical
			- respiratory agitation
			- racing pulse
			- high blood pressure
			- headaches
			- colitis
			- gastritis
			- heart attacks
		- Psychological
			- fatigue
			- depression
			- stress
			- anxiety
			- hysteria
			- sleep and behavioral disorders
				- Noise above 45 dB stops you from falling asleep; the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) states that it should be no more than 30 dB.
				- It can cause aggressive behavior and irritability.
			- memory and concentration
				- It can harm focus and memory, which can lead to poor performance and can make studying less effective.
				- The ears need to rest for 16 hours at most to make up for two hours of exposure to 100 dB.
	- Technology to control noise pollution
		- [[Active Noise Cancellation]] (ANC)
			- Function
				- It uses microphones to capture ambient noise and generates inverted sound waves to cancel it out.
			- Application
				- ANC headphones are widely used for creating quiet listening experiences in noisy environments.
		- [[Passive Noise Reduction]] (PNR)
			- Function
				- It relies on physical barriers (e.g., soundproofing materials) to absorb or reflect sound waves.
			- Application
				- PNR is commonly used in soundproofed rooms, noise barriers along highways, and double-glazed windows in buildings.
		- [[Electric Vehicle|Electric Vehicles]] (EVs)
			- Function
				- They produce significantly less noise than traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.
			- Application
				- The growing adoption of EVs offers a long-term solution to road traffic noise.
		- Quieter engine design
			- Function
				- Advancements in engine design, such as the use of sound-absorbing materials and improved engine lubrication, can significantly reduce engine noise in various vehicles and machinery.
			- Application
				- This approach is continuously being applied in aircraft engine design, construction equipment, and other noise-emitting machinery.
		- Urban planning and zoning regulations
			- Function
				- Implementing thoughtful urban planning practices can mitigate noise pollution. For instance, by placing noise-filled areas (e.g., airport and factories) away from residential areas and creating green spaces to act as natural sound barriers.
			- Application
				- Zoning regulations can limit noise in certain areas and set operation times for noisy activities.
	- Regulations in the Philippines
		- National regulations by the DENR
			- [[DAO 2000-81]]
				- Establishes nationally recognized noise standards, which defines acceptable noise levels, for various areas depending their primary usage.
			- [[Memorandum Circular No. 002, Series of 1980]]
				- Defines limits on noise levels for various sources, such as construction equipment and vehicle exhaust.
				- Outlines specific prohibitions to prevent excessive noise pollution, such as unnecessary honking during specific times or in specific areas.
		- [[Local Government Unit]] (LGU) Ordinances
			- LGUs have the authority to enact their own noise ordinances to address their unique noise concerns.
			- These ordinances can go beyond national regulations by:
				- Defining additional noise sources.
				- Setting specific curfews.
				- Prescribing penalties for violation.
		- Supporting Law: [[Clean Air Act]] ([[RA 8749]])
			- It indirectly contributes to control of noise pollution through the following:
				- Provisions regarding motor vehicle noise emissions.
				- [[Department of Transportation]] (DOTr) are given the authority to set regulations and standards for acceptable noise levels emitted by vehicles.
