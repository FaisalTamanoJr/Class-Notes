- [[Environmental Impact Assessment]] (EIA)
	- EIA is a process used to predict and evaluate the relevant effects of developmental proposals prior to any major decisions being taken.
	- History
		- 1969
			- Creation of the EIA.
			- The U.S. passed its first [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA).
		- 1974
			- Columbia introduced the EIA to their policies.
		- 1978
			- The Philippines also introduced the EIA to their policies.
		- 1989
			- EIA was adopted as a major developmental project by the World Bank.
	- Objectives
		- Identify, predict, and evaluate the economic, environmental, and social impact of developmental activities.
		- Ensure that environmental considerations are incorporated to the decision making process.
	- Laws in the Philippines
		- [[Presidential Decree 1511]]
			- PD 1511 is also known as the [[Philippine Environmental Policy]].
			- It emphasizes the EIA for sustainable development.
		- [[Presidential Decree 1586]]
			- PD 1586 is also known as the [[Environmental Impact Statement System]].
			- It promotes a harmonious balance between socio-economic development and environmental protection.
		- [[RA 7611]]
			- RA 7611 is also known as the [[Strategic Environmental Plan for Palawan Act of 1992]].
			- It requires all government projects to align with the [[Environmentally Critical Areas Network]] (ECAN) for the sustainable development of the province.
		- [[RA 9279]]
			- RA 9279 is also known as the [[Climate Change Act of 2009]].
			- It integrates climate change adaption and mitigation to all government agencies’ policy making activities.
		- [[Presidential Decree 856]]
			- PD 856 is also known as the [[Philippine Sanitation Code]].
			- Establishes sanitary standards for various sectors.
		- [[Presidential Decree 979]]
			- PD 979 is also known as the [[Marine Pollution Decree of 1976]].
			- It prohibits dumping waste into Philippine waters, except if the National Pollution Control Commission or the Philippine Coast Guard approves it.
	- Stages
		1. Screening
			- It refers to the initial evaluation process that is used to determine whether a proposed project requires a full EIA.
		2. Scoping
			- Scoping is the process of determining the extent of the environmental impacts to be considered in the EIA.
		3. EIA report
			- The EIA report outlines the findings of the EIA, including the details, impacts, and mitigation measures.
		4. Review
			- The evaluation and assessment of the EIA report by relevant authorities and stakeholders.
		5. Decision
			- Decision refers to the stage where regulatory bodies decide whether to approve or reject the project proposal.
- Differences of [[Environmental Impact Assessment]] (EIA), [[Environmental Impact Statement]] (EIS), and [[Environmental Management Plan]] (EMP)
	1. EIA
		- It shows why the project was implemented.
		- It shows what the project requires to be implemented.
		- It shows how affected areas will be affected by the project.
		- It determines the [[environmental receptors]] of the project. Moreover, measures are also made for each environmental receptor to minimize the project’s impact on them.
	2. EIS
		1. It compares the pros and cons of the project’s impacts.
		2. It states alternative solutions to the problem tackled by the proposed project.
		3. It identifies other possible impacts to environmental receptors, and it also discusses how those possible impacts should be tackled.
		4. It is a policy document and not a scientific research.
	3. EMP
		1. It shows the measures undertaken to minimize the environmental impact during and after the project’s implementation.
		2. It shows how avoidable impacts, in parts like the construction and operation of the project, can be prevented by the implementers.
		3. It shows how to increase the project’s advantages.
