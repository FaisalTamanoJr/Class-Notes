			- Residential waste pertains to the waste generated at home.
			- It is the most well known source of waste.
		- Industrial waste
			- Industrial waste consists of materials discarded during industrial activities, such as manufacturing, processing, and mining.
			- It can include chemical, hazardous, and non-hazardous materials (e.g., scrap metal, solvents, and waste from food processing).
		- Commercial waste
			- Commercial waste originates from establishments engaged in business activities, like retail stores, offices, and restaurants.
			- It encompasses a wide range of waste products, including paper, packaging materials, food scraps, and electronic waste. It is similar to municipal waste but generated by businesses.
		- Institutional waste
			- Institutional waste is generated by facilities like schools, hospitals, government buildings, and prisons.
			- It includes paper, plastics, food waste, and medical waste.
		- Construction and demolition waste
			- Construction and demolition waste is produced from the construction, renovation, and demolition of buildings, roads, and bridges.
			- It includes materials such as concrete, wood, asphalt, metals, bricks, and glass. Moreover, it can contain hazardous materials like glass and sheet metal; it can also contain inert waste such as bricks and cement.
		- Municipal waste
			- Municpial waste is also known as solid waste.
			- It consists of household waste, commercial waste, and waste from public services that are collected and treated by or for municipalities.
			- It includes a variety of materials, such as food scraps, paper, cardboard, plastics, textiles, and yard waste.
		- Agricultural waste
			- Agricultural waste is generated from farming activities. It includes crop residues, animal manure, and other organic materials discarded during agricultural production processeses.
			- It can be a valuable resource for [[composting]] and bioenergy production.
			- It is mostly biodegradable.
	- Classification
		- [[biodegradable waste|Biodegradable waste]]
			- Biodegradable waste refers to any organic material that can be broken down by microorganisms into simpler substances for the environment.
			- This includes, food waste, garden waste, paper, and certain types of agricultural residues.
			- It is a valuable resource for [[composting]] and bioenergy production.
		- [[non-biodegradable waste|Non-biodegradable waste]]
			- Non-biodegradable waste consists of materials that cannot be easily broken down through natural processes.
			- This includes many types of metals, glass, and certain synthetic materials.
			- Due to their persistence in the environment, they can accumulate and pose long-term pollution challenges. Managing them often involve recycling, [[incineration]], and landfilling.
		- [[recyclable waste|Recyclable waste]]
			- Recyclable waste encompasses materials that can be collected, processed, and transformed into new products.
			- It commonly includes paper, cardboard, glass, metals, and certain plastics.
		- [[inert waste|Inert waste]]
			- Inert waste is characterized by its attribute of not undergoing any significant physical, chemical, or biological transformations once disposed of. For this reason, it does not decompose or release pollutants into the environment.
			- Examples include construction and demolition materials.
			- While it is relatively harmless, it still requires proper disposal to avoid unnecessary use of landfill space.
		- [[hazardous waste|Hazardous waste]]
			- Hazardous waste poses significant threats to public health or the environment because it includes waste materials that are toxic, corrosive, flammable, reactive, or contain infectious properties. As a result, it requires special handling, treatment, and disposal methods to mitigate its harmful effects.
			- Common sources include industrial processes, medical facilities, and household hazardous waste (e.g., batteries, paint, and chemicals).
	- Composition
		- [[organic waste|Organic waste]]
			- Organic waste comprises waste materials that are biological in origin, including food scraps, garden waste, and wood.
			- This type of waste is biodegradable and can be processed into compost or biogas through methods like [[composting]] or anaerobic digestion.
		- Paper and cardboard
			- These materials are recyclable and can be reprocessed into new paper products.
			- Paper and cardboard waste includes newspapers, magazines, office paper, packaging materials, and cardboard boxes.
		- Plastics
			- Plastic waste encompasses a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials, including packaging, bottles, bags, and other consumer products.
			- Plastics can be categorized as [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET), [[high-density polyethylene]] (HDPE), and [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC).
				- PET and HDPE are commonly and easily recycled.
				- PVC, on the other hand, is difficult to recycle due to the presence of chlorine and other chemicals.
		- Glass
			- Glass waste is recyclable and can be melted down and reformed into new glass products indefinitely without losing purity or quality.
			- It includes bottles, jars, and other glass products.
		- Metals
			- Metal waste consists of ferrous metals (iron and steel) and non-ferrous metals (aluminum, copper, and brass).
			- They are valuable materials that can be recycled repeatedly without degrading.
		- Textiles
			- Textile waste includes discarded clothing, fabrics, and other textile materials.
			- It can originate from household, commercial, or industrial sources.
			- It is difficult to recycle due to the variety of materials and dyes used.
		- E-waste ([[electronic waste]])
			- E-waste refers to discarded electronic devices and equipment, such as computers, smartphones, TVs, and appliances.
			- Proper recycling of e-waste can recover valuable materials (e.g., metals) and prevent environmental pollution from hazardous substances.

			- Private sector involvement
				- The private sector plays an important role in waste collection and management, especially in commercial and industrial areas.
				- Private waste management companies offer services ranging from regular waste pickup to specialized handling of hazardous or industrial waste.
		- Waste minimization, reuse, and recycling
			- Waste minimization
				1. Prioritizing the most impactful
					- This principle aims to prevent waste generation at the source itself. It involves the following:
						- Buying less and opting for durable and multipurpose products.
						- Borrowing or renting instead of buying individual items.
						- Choosing products with minimal packaging
							- Opt for bulk purchases or refillable options.
						- [[Composting]] food scraps
							- This reduces landfill waste and creates a nutrient-rich soil for gardens.
				2. Reuse
					- Extending the life of existing items. Before discarding anything, consider the following:
						- Repair broken items instead of replacing them.
						- Repurpose old items.
						- Donate unwanted items in good condition.
						- Sell usable items through online platforms or garage sales.
				3. Recycling
					- Recycle properly by familiarizing yourself with local recycling programâ€™s guidelines.
					- Properly clean and sort recyclables according to local instructions.
					- Choose products made with recycled content to incentivize sustainable practices.
			- Importance for sustainability

- [[Materials Recovery Facilities]] (MRF)
	- An MRF is a plant designed to receive, separate, and prepare recyclable materials for marketing to end-user manufacturers.
	- Types
		- Clean MRF
			- Clean MRFs utilize mechanical and manual methods to sort and prepare recyclable materials.
			- They sort **source-separated** recyclabes, with a focus on ensuring quality and quantity.
			- Steps
				1. The recyclable materials are taken to clean MRFs through a [[bag breaker]], a machinery that opens bags and enhances the separation of materials.
				2. The incoming material passes through a [[Trommel screen]], separating the large lighter mixed paper and cardboard fractions from other materials.
				3. It then passes through a [[ballistic separator]], where the materials are further segregated based on their dimensions and weight.
				4. Afterwards, it passes through a [[magnetic separator]], extracting steel cans and other ferrous metals.
				5. The [[air knife]] or [[air separator]] may be used to extract contamination from the glass fraction.
				6. Non-ferrous metals are then separated using the [[Eddy current separator]].
				7. [[Near-Infrared|NIR]] and [[optical sorting]] is applied, which will have an analysis of materials passing through the sorting line, exact recognition, and sorting of a number of different types of plastics based on their polymer composition.
		- Dirty MRF
			- Dirty MRFs **extract recyclable materials from mixed waste** through the use of mechanical sorting equipment and manual labor.
			- The quantity and quality of materials recovered are decreased, when compared to Clean MRFs, due to the materials being more contaminated.
	- Technology innovations
		- [[optical sorting|Optical sorting]]
			- Utilizes sensors to discern material properties based on its optical characteristics, and then separates through their air jets.
		- [[artificial intelligence|Artificial intelligence]] (AI) and [[robotics]]
			- Robots, supported by AI, are capable of sorting recyclables more accurately and at a higher rate (when compared to human sorters).
		- [[Near-Infrared]] (NIR) Technology
			- Seems to make identification possible on various types of plastics to be more precise with sorting.
- [[Composting]]
	- Decomposting waste into nutrient-rich compost, for a healthier soil and reduction of waste volume to dispose of, requires management of temperature, moisture, and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio.
