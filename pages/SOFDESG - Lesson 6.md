- Testing
	- The process of executing the program to find errors. It can show the presence of bugs, but never their absence.
	- Good practices
		- Has a high chance of finding an undiscovered bug, not about checking if the program works properly.
		- It is impossible to test your own program.
		- Throughly inspect the results of each tests. A necessary part is to have a description of the expected result.
		- Avoid non-reproducible or on-the-fly testing.
		- Write test cases for both valid and invalid input conditions.
		- As the number of detected defects increases, the probability of the existence of more undetected defects also increases.
		- Assign your best people to testing.
		- Ensure that testability is a key objective in your software design. In fact, testing must start with objectives.
		- Never alter the program to make testing easier.
	- Integration testing
		- Individual components are combined and is tested as a group.
	- Validation testing
		- The process of evaluating the software is to determine if it satisfies the business requirements.
	- Acceptance testing
		- Is used to determine if the requirements and specifications are met
		- Alpha and beta testing
			- Alpha testing is a type of user acceptance testing, where software is tested before being released to the actual users.
			- Beta testingâ€¦
	- System testing
		- Types
			- Smoke testing - is used to decide if the build is fit for further testing.
			- Functional testing - features work as per the functional requirements.
			- Regression testing - is a type of testing that ensures that code changes does not impact the existing functionality of the product.
			- Usability testing - determines if the system is user-friendly.
			- Performance testing - determines if the system is reponsive and stable.
			- Security testing - to uncover system vulnerabilities and to protect data and resources from possible intruders
			- Compliance testing - to determine if the system complies with the standards.
	- Test Planning
		- Test plan - defines the scope of the work.
		- Test procedure - container document that holds all the individual tests (tests scripts) that are to be executed.
		- Test report - documents what occurs when the scripts are ran.
		- Validation test plan
