- [[radioactive waste|Radioactive waste]]
	- Sources
		- medical procedures
		- industrial applications
		- operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities
	- Types
		- [[Low-Level Waste]] (LLW)
			- Radioactive content
				-  $<4 \frac{GBq}{t}$  of alpha activity
				- $<12 \frac{GBq}{t}$ of beta-gamma activity
			- They do not require shielding and handling during transport.
			- They are suitable for disposal in near surface facilities.
			- They are generated from hospitals and industries (e.g., rags, papers, tools, and other materials that only contain small traces of short-lived radioactivity).
			- They take up 90% of the volume, but only account for 1% of all radioactive waste.
		- [[Intermediate-Level Waste]] (ILW)
			- They are more radioactive than LLW but do not produce enough heat to be considered in the design of storage and disposal facilities ($<2 \frac{kW}{m^3}$).
			- They require shielding.
			- They typically come from resins, chemical sludges, , metal fuel cladding, and contaminated materials from reactor decommissioning.
			- They take up 7% of the volume and account for 4% of all radioactive waste.
		- [[High-Level Waste]] (HLW)
			- They are hazardous because they can produce fatal radiation doses during brief periods of direct exposure.
			- They come from unusable/inefficient uranium fuel from nuclear power reactors.
			- They are suited for heat decay ($>2 \frac{kW}{m^3}$).
			- They require cooling and shielding.
			- They take up 3% of the volume and account for 95% of all radioactive waste.
			- Kinds
				- Used fuel that has been designated as waste.
				- Separated waste from reprocessing of used fuel.
		- [[exempt waste|Exempt waste/very low-level waste]]
			- They contain radioactive materials that are not considered harmful for neither humans nor the environment.
			- They are mainly made up of demolished materials, such as concrete, plaster, and bricks.
			- Waste is disposed with [[domestic refuse]] (combustible materials that result from activities while living at a residence).
	- Classification is based on
		- [[radioactivity|Radioactivity]]
		- Duration of [[decay]]
	- Technologies and approaches to safely dispose radioactive waste
		- [[vitrification]] for [[High-Level Waste]] (HLW)
		- immobilization and deep geological storage for long term containment
		- reprocessing and reutilization of radioactive waste
	- Treatment
		- Treatment operations involve changing the characteristics of waste streams to improve safety or the economy.
		- It can be done by compaction (to reduce volume), filtration, or ion exchange (to remove radionuclide content), or precipitation (to alter composition).
	- Conditioning
		- Conditioning refers to the transformation of waste into a form suitable for safe handling, transportation, storage, and disposal.
		- It involves the immobilization of waste into containers.
		- Liquid [[Low-Level Waste|LLW]] and [[Intermediate-Level Waste|ILW]] are typically solidified in cement, while [[High-Level Waste|HLW]] is [[calcined]]/dried then [[vitrified]] in a glass matrix.
	- Effects
		- Radioactive waste from the leftover fuel of a reactor can remain active for a period of 1,000-10,000 years (radioactivity of [[High-Level Waste|HLW]] decays). Hence, it has the following effects on humans and the environment:
			- Spent nuclear fuel is harmful for humans and the environment because it releases plutonium, a poisonous chemical.
			- Exposure to radioactive materials can cause cancer in humans, and genetic damage and mutations in animals.
			- Exposure to radioactive contamination can also cause cause anemia, leukemia, hemorrhages, and cardiovascular diseases in humans.
			- Improper disposal of radioactive waste can lead to soil infertility because plants grown in contaminated soils may absorb the radiation, resulting to its build up.
	- Storage
		- Radioactive waste are typically stored in concrete or steel storage cask above ground or in an air-cooled, shielded concrete vault.
		- If they only contain radionuclides with half-lives measured in days or weeks, such as some medical and research isotopes, storing them can eliminate their radioactivity and convert them into a nonradioactive waste.
		- For other radioactive materials, storing them for a period of time can reduce their radioactivity and heat generation. As a consequence, reducing transport and disposal site costs and risks.
	- Control and management
		- The [[Philippine Nuclear Research Institute]] (PNRI) have developed the specific Code of PNRI Regulations, which include the following:
			1. CPR PART 3: Standards for Radiation Protection
				- This was largely based on [[IAEA SS 115]]: International Basic Safety Standards.
				- Provision for the general requirements involving waste management and disposal of licensed radioactive materials include the following:
					- storage under controlled conditions
					- control and monitoring of environmental discharges
					- regulatory limit for airborne and waterborne discharges, and solid waste materials, adopting IAEA Clearance Levels.
			2. CPR PART 4: Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials in the Philippines.
				- This was based on [[IAEA ST-R-1]]: Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials.
			3. CPR PART 21: Licensing and Safety Requirements of Particle Accelerator Facilities for the Production of Radioisotopes.
				- Published in 2005.
			4. CPR PART 23: Licensing Requirements for Land Disposal of Radioactive Waste.
				- Published in 2005.
			5. CPR PART 26: Security of Radioactive Sources.
				- Published in 2007.
