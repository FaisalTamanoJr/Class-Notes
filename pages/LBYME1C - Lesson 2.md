- # [[CAD]]
	- Stands for [[Computer-Aided Design]]
	- Uses computer software to create, modify, analyze, and optimize designs and technical drawings
	- Used in a variety of industries, including architecture, engineering, manufacturing, construction, automotive, and aerospace
	- ## Engineering
		- It provides engineers powerful tools to create, analyze, and document designs
		- ### Functions
			- conceptual design
			- detailed design
			- 2d modeling
			- 3d modeling
			- parametric modeling
			- simulation and analysis
			- collaboration
			- design validation
			- prototyping
			- documentation
			- design reuse
			- customization
			- integration
	- ## Software Principles
		- Software principles are a set of fundamental concepts and best practices that guide the use of CAD software in various design and engineering disciplines
		- ### List of Software Principles
			- Digital representation
				- Creation of digital representations of systems, objects, or structures
			- Precision and accuracy
				- Specify dimensions, constraints, and tolerances to ensure that the design meet the standards and specifications
			- Parametric modeling
				- Create relationships and constraints between different elements of the design
			- Layers and organization
				- Organize and categorize elements of the design
			- Standardization
				- Involves adhering to industry-specific standards and conventions
			- Visualization
				- Use 3d modeling and rendering capabilities to help user visualize designs
			- Documentation
				- Create technical documentations including schematics, drawings, [[bill or materials]] (BOM), and assembly instructions
			- Simulation and analysis
				- Use simulation and analysis tools to assess performance, behavior, and stress of designs
			- Collaboration
				- Collaborate among the design teams using the software
			- Data management
				- Integrate with [[Product Lifecycle Management]] (PLM) systems and offer data versioning, revision tracking, and file management features
			- Customization
				- Create custom templates, libraries, and macros to streamline the design process
			- Integration
				- Integrate with other software
			- Data backup and security
				- Implement data backup and security to protect CAD files from loss of unauthorized access
