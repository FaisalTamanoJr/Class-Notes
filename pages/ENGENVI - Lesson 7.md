	- Hazardous wastes
		- Wastes with properties that are harmful to humans or the environment
	- Treatment technologies
		- Biological
			- Aerobic
				- uses oxygen-feeding bacteria, protozoa, and other specialty microbes to clean the wastes.
				- BOD
					- amount of dissolved oxygenâ€¦
			- Anaerobic
				- does not rely on using oxygen
				- direct and indirect symbiotic association between different groups of bacteria
				- two steps
					- initial acid-forming phase
						- undergoes a phase to transform of higher molecular mass compounds into suitable compounds to use as a source of energy
					- methane production phase
						- acidogenesis
							- bacterial conversion of compounds resulting from the first stage to identifiable lower molecular mass compounds
						- methagenesis
							- bacterial conversion of compounds to simpler end products
			- Membrane bioreactor
				- mostly used in municipal, industrial, and landfill
				- combination of microfiltration membrane with a growth bioreactor
				- bioreactor
					- chamber that supports a biologically active environment consisting of bacteria and protozoa
				- membrane
					- solid liquid separation
				- types
					- sidestream (or external) in case of pressure driven
			- Constructor wetlands
				- use of naturall processes involving wetland vegetation
				- free water surface constructed wetlands
					- flooded planted channels or basin
				- horizontal subsurface flow
					- gravel
			- Biomedication
				- use of living organism to purge contaminants and toxins from soil and water
				- bacteria bioremediation
					- used in industrial hazardous waste
				- fungal bioremediation
			- Biofiltration
				- treatment of contaminated air and water through biological filters
				- biofilters: the microorganism attach themselves and purge the contaminants by capturing and degrading
		- Physical
			- physically alters the waste properties to make it safer for disposal
			- aims to reduce wastes mobility volume or activity
			- drawbacks
				- limited treatment
				- secondary waste streams
				- significant energy consumption
				- incomplete hazard elimination
			- different physical treatment proccesses
				- screening
					- separating larger particles or objects from a mixture of waste materials
					- achieved by passing the waste through a screen or mesh with openings of a specific size
				- filtration
					- passing a waste mixture through a porous material that would separate solids from liquid or gas
					- different types of filtration
						- gravity filtration
						- pressur filtration
						- vacuum filtration
				- sedimentation
					- removing suspended solid particles from a waste stream
					- relies on the difference of density
					- if certain particles are too small, flotation is used
				- centrifugation
					- separates solid and liquid components by rapidly rotating a mixture at high speeds in a centrifugal machine
				- stripping
					- widely used in removing volatile organic compounds (vocs) of a liquid mixture by passing streams of gas
				- reverse osmosis
					- pushses a solution through a semi permeable membrane under pressure, allowing water molecules to flow through but obstructing most other pollutants
				- evaporation
					- involves boiling off the liquid part of the waste stream in order to concentrate non volatile solids in a solution
					- reduces the volume of hazardous substances
				- incineration
					- uses the combustion of waste materials at high temperatures in a controlled environment
					- breaks down organic compounds
				- distillation
					- different boiling points are used to separate liquids
					- involves heating the mixture to vaporize the more volatile components then cooling and condensing the vapor back into a liquid form
		- Chemical
			- reduce the hazardous nature of the waste by undergoing a chemical process using chemicals
			- recovery of valuable products and reduce the overall cost of waste disposal
			- different processes
				- ion exchange
					- exchanging with another non-objectionable ionic substance that will result in removing one or more of the contaminants
					- must be dissolved and have the same type of electric charge
					- drawbacks
						- high operation costs over long-term
						- regenerating the ion exchange bed dumps salt water into the environment
				- chemical precipitation
					- process of the contaminants dissolving or suspending in a solution to settle out
					- filtered, centrifuged, or separated
					- removal of metals and other inorganics, and organic substances that may be harmful
					- assisted through using coagulants which are an agent that causes smaller particles suspended in solution to gather larger
					- municipal and industrial wastewater
					- drawbacks
					- polymers used as coagulants can be expensive
					- competing reactions
				- redox
					- oxidation and reduction
					- convert of compounds to make it more stable, less mobile, or inert
					- transfer of electrons wherein one reactant is oxidized and one is reduced
					- oxidizing agents are most commonly used for the treatment of hazardous contaminants
					- drawbacks
						- incomplete oxidation of intermediate contaminants may occur
						- process is not cost-effective
				- neturilization
					- adjusts the pH value of the waste
					- crucial move in a conventional treatment process due to pH being a key element in this process
				- chlorination
					- usage of chlorine dioxide to treat hazardous wastes
					- ensures the drinking water is safe to drink after the treatment
				- ozonation
					- widely considred for the treatment of wastewater by oxidation as ozone
					- direct and indirect oxidation
		- Land disposal
			- involves dumping garbage into or onto the ground
			- drawbacks
				- significant environmental risks
				- emissions of harmful gases
				- long-term liabilities
			- types
				- surface impoundments
					- temporary holds an accumulation of liquid hazardous waste
				- waste piles
			- types of secure landfilles
				- are excavated locations where non liquid hazardous waste is dumped and covered for ultimate disposal
				- most commonly used process
			- critical design standards
				- liners:protective barrier
				- natural hydrogeologic setting: prevents waste from escaping
				- double leachate collection system: designed to automatically pump the leachate to maintain compliance with the requirements.
				- cover: layer of compressed soil laid on top of a deposition of waste
				- implrmeable cap: designed to minimize migration of liquids through the closed landfill
			- example facilities
				- l2612-phi visayas base load pwoer project - secured landfill facility
				- located in brgy tina an naga city
				- aims to mitigate the indiscriminate dumping of coal ash
		- bedrock disposal
			- showcases a multi barrier design where the solid hazardous waste is sealed with dfferent materials to prevent leakage of groundwater
		- deep well disposal
			- uses injection wells to place treated or untreated waste into geological formations that have no possiblities of contamination to water aquifers
