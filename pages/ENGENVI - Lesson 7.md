- [[hazardous waste|Hazardous waste]]
	- Hazardous waste refers to waste from different facilities that can harm humans and the environment.
	- Sources
		- Commercial facilities
		- Industries
		- Institutional facilities
	- Effects
		- Cancer
		- Genetic mutation
		- Kills organisms living underwater
	- Characteristics
		- [[ignitability|Ignitability]]
			- Waste that are hazardous due to ignitability include the following:
				- liquids with flashpoints below $60^\circ C$
				- non-liquids that can cause fires given a specific condition
				- ignitable compressed gas and oxidizers
		- [[corrosivity|Corrosivity]]
			- Corrosive waste refers to waste capable of eroding, corroding, or eating away other substances due to their aggressive properties. Examples include strong bases and acids.
		- [[reactivity|Reactivity]]
			- Reactive waste pertains to waste that react violently with a mixture of substances, potentially causing explosions or releasing toxic fumes, gases, or vapors.
		- [[toxicity|Toxicity]]
			- Toxic waste involves waste that consist of toxic components such as residues that may cause chronic or carcinogenic effects. Moreover, exposure with them can lead to adverse health effects, including poisoning and cancer.
	- Classification
		- [[radioactive waste|Radioactive/Nuclear waste]]
			- Radioactive waste refers to waste that emit ionizing radiation and persist in the environment for a lengthy period.
			- Characteristics
				- [[toxicity]]
				- [[corrosivity]]
			- Examples
				- plutonium from nuclear reactors
				- uranium fuel
		- [[alkali waste|Alkali waste]]
			- They pertain to waste with $\geq 12.5$ pH level
			- Characteristics
				- [[corrosivity]]
			- Examples
				- alkaline cleaners
				- [[ammonium hydroxide]]
				- caustic soda
		- [[biomedical waste|Biomedical/Hospital waste]]
			- They refer to infectious waste originating from research facilities and the diagnosis and treatment of living beings.
			- Characteristics
				- [[toxicity]]
		- [[household waste|Household waste]]
			- Household waste comes from any unused or leftover portion of household products with toxic chemicals.
			- Characteristics
				- [[toxicity]]
				- [[corrosivity]]
				- [[ignitability]]
				- [[reactivity]]
			- Examples
				- batteries
				- motor oil
				- Lysol
		- [[electronic waste|E-waste]]
			- E-waste describes used electronics that are nearing the end of their useful life, and are discarded, donated, or given to a recycler.
			- Characteristics
				- [[toxicity]]
				- [[ignitability]]
			- Examples
				- cell phones
				- chargers
				- headphones
		- [[acid waste|Acid waste]]
			- They pertain to waste with $\leq 2.0$ pH level
			- Characteristics
				- [[corrosivity]]
				- [[ignitability]] ([[sulfuric acid]])
			- Examples
				- [[sulfuric acid]]
				- [[hydrochloric acid]]
				- [[nitric acid]]
		- [[mixed waste|Mixed waste]]
			- They refer to waste with a toxic and radioactive component.
			- Characteristics
				- [[toxicity]]
				- [[radioactivity]]
			- Examples
				- [[zinc bromide]]
				- contaminated lead
				- oils with mercury
	- Directives and legislations
		- [[RA 6969]]: [[Toxic Substances and Hazardous and Nuclear Waste Control Act of 1990]]
			- Declaration of policy
				- Provides for the regulation of toxic, hazardous, and nuclear substances.
				- Provides for the advancement and facilitation of studies on toxic chemicals.
			- Objectives
				- Maintain an inventory of chemicals.
				- Monitor and regulate hazardous chemicals.
				- Educate the public about hazards related to toxic chemicals.
				- Prevent entry and disposal of hazardous chemicals.
			- Prohibited acts
				- a) Intentionally using prohibited chemical substances.
				- b) Failure or refusal to submit reports required by this act.
				- c) Failure or refusal to comply with the pre-manufacture and pre-importation requirements.
				- d) Cause or assist, whether directly or indirectly, the entry of hazardous substances in the Philippines.
			- Penalties for violating the prohibited acts from (a) - (c)
				- imprisonment for 6 months
				- fine ranging from 600 PHP to 400K PHP
				- If the violator is a foreigner, they are deported and barred from any subsequent entry in the country after serving their sentence.
				- If the violator is a government employee, they will also be automatically dismissed from office and permanently disqualified from holding any elective or appointive position.
			- Penalties for violating the prohibited acts from (d)
				- imprisonment for 12 years
				- If the violator is a foreigner, they are deported and barred from any subsequent entry in the country after serving their sentence.
				- If the violator is a government employee, they will also be automatically dismissed from office and permanently disqualified from holding any elective or appointive position.
		- [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] (POPs)
			- It was established in 2001 but enforced in May 17, 2004.
			- It primarily aims to protect human health and the environment from the negative effects of [[Persistent Organic Pollutants|POPs]].
			- They compel participating countries to adopt measures that reduce [[Persistent Organic Pollutants|POP]] releases as much as possible.
			- One of their main provisions is safely managing stockpiles and waste.
			- Annexes
				- Annex A
					- Annex A consists of chemicals whose production and use must be eliminated.
				- Annex B
					- Annex B consists of chemicals whose production and use must be restricted.
				- Annex C
					- Annex C consists of chemicals whose unintentional release must be minimized by taking measures.
			- POPs
				- Characteristics
					- They are capable of dangerously accumulating in humans and animals (toxic).
					- They can be transported over long distances through the atmosphere and oceans.
					- They are resistant to natural decomposition.
				- Effects on human health
					- cancers
					- birth defects
					- reproductive disorders
					- impaired immune, reproductive, and nervous (central and peripheral) systems.
