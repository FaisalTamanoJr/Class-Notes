# Analysis
***
## Style of writing
- From a third person point of view
- Uses a lot of indigenous terminologies
- Very straightforward but detailed

## Conflict
The story possesses a man vs himself conflict since it deals with Tarang growing and becoming mature and independent

It also has a man vs nature conflict because it involves the characters trying to deal with the nature of their environment

## Character development
### Tarang
Tarang grows from being ignorant and not curious to someone who is more aware, mature, and independent

## Themes
- The cycle of life where life emerges from death
	- How the seeds grew from the ash-covered loam or the kaingin
	- How the family owns the land by killing the pullet
- Common filipino archetypes like leader fathers, hardworking mothers, and superstitions.
