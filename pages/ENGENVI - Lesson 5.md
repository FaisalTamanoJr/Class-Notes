- [[air pollutants|Air pollutants]]
	- Air pollutants are elements that are not inherently found in nature; therefore, they can contaminate the atmosphere.
	- Air quality, the characteristic that indicates the level of air pollution in an area, is measured through an [[Air Quality Index]] (AQI).
	- Different places have different AQI standards and tests depending on their local government authority.
	- Philippines makes use of the [[National Ambient Air Quality]] (NAAQGV) set by the [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources]] (DENR).
	- Classifications
		- Via emission
			- Primary pollutants
				- Are the main source of air pollution that directly pollute the air when emitted.
				- They create secondary pollutants through certain chemical reactions.
				- Laws
					- [[Philippine Clean Air Act of 1999]] - [[DAO 81]]
				- Examples
					- [[particulate matter]] (dust, sand, ash)
					- $CO_{2}$
					- $CO$
					- $NO_{x}$
					- $CFC$s
					- $VOC$s
					- [[ammonia]]
			- Secondary pollutants
				- Secondary pollutants are products of primary pollutants that are more hazardous to human health compared to their prior forms.
				- There are no specific laws that directly address them; instead, they are managed by the guideline standards of primary pollutants (see [[DAO 81]]).
				- Examples
					- [[ozone]]
					- [[photochemical smog]]
					- [[acid rain]] ([[sulfuric acid]] and [[nitric acid]])
					- [[ammonium]]
		- Via composition
			- Gaseous pollutant
				- Sources
					- Industries (as a byproduct)
					- farm animals
					- vehicles
					- fumes from commercial products
				- Effects
					- smog formation
					- health risks
						- vision impairment
						- respiratory failure
						- inflammation and irritation
						- reduced mental capability
					- acid rain
					- environmental/biodiversity damage
				- Examples
					- $CO_{2}$
					- $CO$
					- $SOx$
					- $NOx$
					- methane
					- GHGs
					- VOCs
			- Particulate matter
				- Sources
					- volcanic activity
					- vehicle exhaust
					- industrial emissions
					- events involving combustion
				- Classifications
					- PM10
						- “Course particles”, comprise of particles that are smaller than 10 micrometers (in diameter) but bigger than 2.5 micrometers (e.g. dust).
					- PM2.5
						- “Fine particles”, comprise of particles smaller than or equal to 2.5 micrometers (in diameter) but bigger than 0.1 micrometers (e.g. exhaust).
					- PM0.1
						- “Ultrafine particles”, comprise of particles smaller than 0.1 micrometers in diameter (e.g. metal vapors).
				- Effects
					- respiratory and cardiovascular problems
					- complications of respiratory and cardiovascular problems
				- Examples
					- sand
					- volcanic ash
					- dust
					- dirt
					- smoke
			- Biological pollutant
				- Sources
					- plants
					- animals
					- bacteria
					- biological entity excretion
					- forms of population distribution (i.e. pollen from plants and viral and bacterial spread)
				- Effects
					- allergic reactions (mostly from pollen and excretion type \[i.e. urine, fur, dander, and droppings\] or various infectious diseases \[from spread type; i.e. bacteria, viruses, and molds\]).
				- Examples
					- pollen
					- bacteria
					- viruses
					- molds
					- animal hair
					- fur
					- pest excretions
	- Origin
		- Natural
			- Natural sources include anything that was not produced through artificial means.
			- Examples
				- natural disasters
					- wildfires
					- volcanic activity
					- desert storms
		- Mobile
			- Mobile sources include any transport vehicle or automobile emissions.
			- Examples
				- planes
				- boats
				- cars
				- trains
		- Area
			- Area sources include any agricultural or commercial emmision sources.
			- Examples
				- city pollution
				- agricultural production
		- Stationary
			- Stationary sources include anything industrial in nature, including energy manufacturing and waste disposal sites.
			- Examples
				- factories
				- power plants
				- sewage treatment facilities
	- Effects
		- Material effects
			- Calcerous building stones and ferrous metals are the most susceptible to damage from air pollution, potentially causing the following:
				- Loss of material mass.
				- Change in porosity.
				- Discoloration.
		- Vegetative effects
			- Interference in resource accumulation.
				- Contact with the pollutants affect the metabolic function of leaves and interferes with [[carbon fixation]].
		- Health effects
			- short breath
			- coughing and wheezing
			- chest pain
			- fatigue
			- difficulty in breathing
			- sore throat
	- Regulations and legislations
		- [[DAO 14]]
		- [[RA 8749]]
			- Also known as the [[clean air act]].
		- [[Kyoto protocol]]
		- [[Montreal protocol]]
