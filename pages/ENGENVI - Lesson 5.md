- Air environment
	- Importance
		- It can negatively impact human health and the environment.
			- [[Ozone depletion]] leads to reduced protection against [[ultraviolet rays|UV rays]], which can cause sunburns, skin cancer, skin aging, and snow blindness, and immune system suppression in humans.
	- Challenges
		- [[ozone depletion]]
			- Ozone depletion refers to the thinning of the ozone layer in the Earth’s [[stratosphere]].
			- It happens when bromine and chlorine atoms destroy the ozone molecules in the stratosphere faster than it can recover.
				- The ozone depleting substances containing chlorine include the following:
					- [[chlorofluorocarbons]] ($CFC$s)
						- $CFC$s are the most abundant ozone-depleting substance. They originate from a reaction between a chlorine atom and another molecule. In addition, they are released from things such as solvents, spray aerosols, refrigerators, and air-conditioners.
						- History
							- [[Chlorofluorocarbons]] ($CFC$s) were first synthesized in 1928 by [[Thomas Midgley Jr.]], as safer chemicals for refrigerators (coolants) in commercial applications.
							- After [[World War II]], $CFC$s were used as propellants for bug sprays, paints, hair conditioner, and many other healthcare products.
							- In 1974, [[Mario Molina]] and [[Sherwood Rowland]] discovered and detailed the threats $CFC$s pose against the ozone layer. They found that the chlorine released from $CFCs$ destroys ozone in catalytic reactions, where 100,000 ozone molecules can be destroyed per chlorine atom.
							- [[Mario Molina]] and [[Sherwood Rowland]]'s study was validated in 1985, when a hole in the ozone layer was observed over Antartica.
							- The [[Montreal protocol]] was signed in 1987 to reduce ozone-depleting substances.
					- [[carbon tetrachloride]]
					- [[hydrochlorofluorocarbons]] ($HCFC$s)
					- [[methyl chloroform]]
				- On the other hand, ozone depleting substances containing bromide include the following:
					- [[haloalkanes|halons]]
					- [[methyl bromide]]
					- [[hydrobromofluorocarbons]] ($HBFC$s)
		- [[acid deposition]]
			- Acid deposition, also known as [[acid rain]], is the occurence of air pollutants rising to the atmosphere and reacting with water vapor to produce acidic compounds (i.e. [[sulfuric acid]] and [[nitric acid]]), which fall back to the ground in two possible forms:
				- Wet deposition
					- Acidic compounds fall as rain, snow, or hail.
				- Dry deposition
					- Acidic compounds fall as dust.
			- The air pollutants that are responsible for acid deposition are [[sulfur dioxide]] ($SO_{2}$) and [[nitrogen oxide]] ($NO$), which react with oxygen gas ($O_{2}$) and water vapor to form [[sulfuric acid]] ($H_{2}SO_{4}$) and [[nitric acid]] ($HNO_{3}$). These compounds can decrease the pH level of rain to drop to below 5.6, which turns it into acidic rain.
			- Potential effects
				- Damages roots and leaves of plants.
				- Increase in the pH level of water bodies.
				- Destruction of marine life.
				- Corrosion of man-made structures.
		- [[global warming]] and [[climate change]]
			- Global warming pertains to the temperature increase in Earth due to the trapped heat from the sun, which is caused by greenhouse gases.
			- Its rapid escalation is a result of increased usage of $CO_{2}$ that produces a heat trapping blanket, which is known as the greenhouse effect. Moreover, the effect is also exacerbated by burning fossil fuels (e.g., coal and petroleum) and other greenhouse gases. Because the temperature rises, it results to the melting of glaciers or ice caps and the growth of sea levels.
			- Greenhouse effect is just the concept of confining heat inside a greenhouse. Its primary source are the industrial sector, with some smaller contributing factors like deforestation and agriculture.
			- Although global warming and climate change are used interchangeably, they are not the same; they are just related.
		- [[carbon footprint]]
			- Carbon footprint is the total amount of [[carbon dioxide]] that a person or action is responsible for releasing into the atmosphere.
	- [[air pollutants|Air pollutants]]
		- Air pollutants are elements that are not natural; therefore, they can contaminate the atmosphere.
		- Air quality, the characteristic that indicates the level of air pollution in an area, is measured through an [[Air Quality Index]] (AQI).
		- Different places have different AQI standards and tests depending on their local government authority.
		- Philippines makes use of the [[National Ambient Air Quality Guideline Values]] (NAAQGV) set by the [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources]] (DENR).

			- This act also specifies many terms used in relation to air pollution, with terms that describe the pollution (air pollution, air pollutant), terms that are used to describe air quality (ambient air quality guideline values), and other related terms.
			- The act introduces an air quality management system that aims to keep track of air quality around the country through the following:
				1. Air quality monitoring and information network
