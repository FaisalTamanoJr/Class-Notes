# Analysis
***
## Style of writing
- It is written in third person but mostly from the perspective of Alfredo Salazar
- It is creative with its description of the environment, the characters’ feelings, and the characters’ appearance

## Conflict
The story possesses a man vs. himself conflict where the protagonist have a [[Cyrenaicism|cyrenaicist]] perspective of love—focusing more on short but intense pleasure. He is a slave to new experiences, as seen with his behavior towards Esperanza and Julia at the start. Once he exhausts all of love’s fuel for a short moment, his interests for the person he’s in love with disappears—just like a star that uses all its fuel and loses its ability to produce energy.

## Character development
### Alfredo Salazar
At the start, his actions and morality seem to indicate that they are guided by emotions—he cheats on his wife and he is constantly in a search for short term but intense pleasure. In addition, he also does not seem to be religious, as seen from his reaction upon knowing about Calixta’s relationship.

Nevertheless, he conforms to societal norms and expectations of others. In other words, he does not want to be judge negatively; for this reason, he does not cancel his engagement with Esperanza and inform Julia about his marriage. His marriage with Esperanza seemed like it was not because he loves her but because he feels like it could lead to harsh social consequences after being engaged with her for so long.

His acceptance of his marriage was a product of his detachment derived from solace. He copes by being remote and emotionally uninvolved with what he faces. In other words, it stopped mattering to him because he felt powerless.

## Themes
From a historical perspective, this story can be interpreted as the transition between the Spanish governance and the American one, where Filipinos are leaving their tradition because of their excitement to experience the new things that the Americans introduced—similar to Alfredo losing his interest for Esperanza (the religious and conservative character) to be with Julia (the modern and more progressive character). Nevertheless, the length of the Spanish occupation had a more lasting effect on Filipino culture than the American one—just like how Alfredo still ends up with Esperanza at the end—and the superficial interest for the things that the Americans introduced died down over time.

Its title might be a reference to a star using all of its nuclear fuel and losing its ability to generate energy. This is similar to how Alfredo sacrifices all of the good potential of the future for the sake of the present. Alfredo mistakenly perceives a star with low intrinsic brightness, or luminosity, as a distant star with high luminosity; however, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear to him that it is a star with low luminosity because because of being used up.
