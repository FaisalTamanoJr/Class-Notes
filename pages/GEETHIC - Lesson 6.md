# Classical Virtue Ethics

Unlike [[consequentialism]] and [[deontology]], [[virtue ethics]] is primarily concerned with the character of a person instead of their actions. It focuses more on “What type of person I should be?” Rather than “What is the right decision?” Hence, motives behind an action is instrumental in assessing the *moral quality* of an act. The combination of **right action** and **right intention** is what makes a person virtuous.

## Aristotelian Ethics

[[Aristotelian ethics]] was taken from *Nicomachean Ethics*, which was written by Aristotle’s son, Nicomachus.[^a_ethics] For Aristotle, the good actions are ones that lead to *eudaimonia*—a virtue that is wanted for its own sake.

### Eudaimonia

[[Eudaimonia]] roughly translates to **happiness**, **well-being**, or **flourishing**. It is the end goal for all our actions. For us to attain it, we must fulfill our essence/nature by accomplishing our proper function.[^function] Because humans distinctly have the capacity to reason and act based on it, Aristotle believed that living in accordance with reason was our proper function. Therefore, we should let our rational faculty prevail over lower faculties (i.e., desire and passion) because we need it to achieve eudaimonia. Moreover, we ought to nurture our reasoning skills for the same reason.

### Concept of Virtue

[[virtue|Virtues]] enables us to fulfill our proper function, and, as such, Aristotle maintains that they are necessary for us to live a happy life. He categorized virtues into two types: *intellectual virtues* and *moral virtues*. The former allows us to reasonably think, while the latter enables us to rationally manage our emotions and desires.

Virtues are either learned through experience or acquired through habits. For instance, *practical wisdom* (an intellectual virtue) is learned through experience. On the other hand, justice, prudence, fortitude, and temperance are developed through habitual actions. This implies that moral virtues are not inherent in our nature, but it is formed through constant practice. For this reason, Aristotle referred to things which are intrinsic to our nature (e.g., our ability to see and hear) as *endowments*—to distinguish them from virtues.

Aristotle states that virtue comes from repeatedly doing the right thing; thus, it is internal process since it underscores the importance of building the right character. In contrast, *moral action* is an external exercise since it only focuses on the right decision. Although they are related, they are still different: one can do a good action while not necessarily being virtuous, and one can be virtuous and give in to performing an immoral act.

> [!QUOTE]- Quote Illustrating the Distinction Between Virtue and Moral Action
> A man who steals is not necessarily a thief; he stole, to be sure, and committed a misdeed, but a thief steals because it is his nature to do so. If an honest man steals, it is usually out of dire necessity, such as the avoidance of starvation, because everything is in him rebels against stealing. The same holds true of a good man who kills; he is not a murderer unless he murders by nature, that is, becomes a killer, but the person who by nature is not a killer may commit an isolated act of homicide purely in self-defence.

A *virtuous person* is one who enjoys doing *virtuous actions* because it became natural to them after constant practice. As Aristotle says, “A man who abstains from bodily pleasures and enjoys doing so is self-controlled; if he finds it troublesome, he is self-indulgent; a man who endures danger with joy, or at least without pain, is courageous; if he endures it with pain, he is a coward.” Aristotle believed that, in order to become virtuous, one must engage in moral actions with pleasure and contentment.[^eudaimonia]

### The Doctrine of the Mean

Although vice and virtue are similar (i.e., vice is also a product of habit and is enjoyable), Aristotle states that [[vice]] is either the *extreme of excess* or *extreme of deficiency* (with respect to character traits). On the other hand, virtue is the balance between either extremes. Aristotle sheds light on the positive effects of acting in accordance to the median, by comparing it to food—too much or too little will damage our health, while only consuming a proportionate amount will strengthen it. In the table below, Martin summarizes Aristotle’s discussed virtues with their corresponding excess, deficiencies, situation, and type of emotion.

| Kind of Situation          | Type of Emotion         | Excess Vice       | Virtue          | Deficiency Vice      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Responses to danger        | Fear, confidence        | Foolhardiness     | Courage         | Cowardice            |
| Satisfaction of appetites  | Physical pleasure       | Overindulgence    | Temperance      | Inhibition           |
| Giving gifts               | Desire to help          | Extravagance      | Generosity      | Miseliness           |
| Pursuit of accomplishments | Desire to succeed       | Vaulting ambition | Proper ambition | Unambitiousness      |
| Appraisal of oneself       | Self-confidence         | Vanity            | Proper pride    | Sense of inferiority |
| Self-expression            | Desire to be recognized | Boastfulness      | Truthfulness    | False modesty        |
| Responses to insults       | Anger                   | Irascibility      | Patience        | Apathy               |
| Social conduct             | Attitudes to others     | Obsequiousness    | Friendliness    | Rudeness             |
| Awareness of one’s flaws   | Shame                   | Shyness           | Modesty         | Shamelessness        |
| Conservation, humor        | Amusement               | Buffoonery        | Wittiness       | Boorishness          |

Nonetheless, Aristotle claims that the median is relative to the person, not the act. For example, it is courageous for a soldier to join the war; however, it is reckless for an ordinary citizen to do the same. Similarly, a weightlifter is sufficiently eating when consuming 10 pounds of food (since they require plenty of energy for their specialization), while eating the same amount for an ordinary person is considered too much.

Besides this, Aristotle also states that the model (found at the table shown previously) does not cover all types of cases. Cases involving actions and emotions that connote baseness do not have a mean. Adultery, in-nature, is wrong; there is no excess nor deficient adultery. Hence, a median does not exist for this action. This example illustrates how some things can never have a mean.

### Evaluating Aristotle’s virtue Ethics

#### The Good

This ethical theory stresses the importance of good character in living a moral life. It requires one to have good character to do good deeds, and, as such, promotes good motives behind kind actions. The consequence of cultivating good character leads to a happy virtuous life, where good moral agents are reliably or consistently good; in other words, they have a high propensity of acting good as a result of their nurtured character.

Another positive is that, not only does it cover good actions, but it also encourages us to fully develop our selves. Aristotelian ethics provides some guidelines that assist us in determining our ideal moral selves; thus, we are given a goal that we can strive for and are provided instructions on how we can transform ourselves into good people.

#### The Bad

A major criticism raised against Aristotelian ethics is the lack of clear instructions when dealing with specific moral issues. Although it greatly covers the character of an individual and its importance, it does not define which positions/actions are morally correct, such as in the case of abortion, death penalty, and etc.

In addition, this ethical theory does not provide concrete or clear guidelines for determining the median. Despite Aristotle including a myriad of variables to consider (e.g., time, object, person, etc.), it is still ambiguous, thereby making it too difficult to assess whether our actions are too much or too little.[^practical_wisdom]

Before we can follow another virtuous person’s action, we first have to identify if a person is virtuous or not depending on the actions they take. Our logic falls under circular reasoning when we argue that a virtuous act is one which a virtuous person does, then afterward claim that a virtuous person is one which does virtuous acts.

Another criticism raised against Aristotelian ethics is the premise that humans have one purpose. Several philosophical theories such as existentialism or postmodernism conflict with this notion; our nature or purpose is not limited to reason only (e.g., some theories suggest that we create our own meaning). In addition, there are also some things we can do better than other species besides our reasoning abilities. Hence, we cannot conclude that our nature is defined solely by our reason.

We can also extrapolate David Hume’s criticism of [[natural law theory]] to Aristotelian ethics: we cannot conflate what *is* (descriptive) with what *ought* (normative) to be. Just because it is within our nature to act reasonably, **does not entail that we should** act reasonably. Hume holds that our values is distinct from non-moral natural facts; hence, morality should be discussed separately from our natural needs.

## Confucian Ethics

### Highlights of Confucius’ Life

[[Confucius]] was born in a family that was generally poor, even though his father was from a noble lineage. His work experiences revealed to him a myriad of social injustices. As a result, he took different influential roles in the government to institute social changes. Nevertheless, he lost his position and was forced to leave Lu after offending a powerful nobleman. He then went to teach in several states. In his final moments as a scholar, he edited works that were later referred to as *Confucian classics*.

> [!SUMMARY] Observations from the Life of Confucius that Reflect his Ethical Teachings
> - One could be a noble person despite not being born in an aristocratic family.
> - He deeply loved and respected his family.
> - He was good at teaching and really enjoyed learning.
> - He used his knowledge for the greater good—by dealing with social injustices.
> - Even after losing his government positions, he still taught others so that he could initiate social changes.

### Overview of Confucianism

[[Confucianism]] was derived from an ancient Chinese tradition known as the *Ru* tradition. More recently, Ru referred to individuals who studied a specific set of fields, and learned the *six classics*.[^six_classics] Because Confucius epitomized the Ru, the sixteenth century Jesuits called the Ru tradition “Confucianism”.

There are two main readings for this tradition: the *Five Classics* (or the *Confucian Classics*) and the *Four Books*. The former is composed of the following books:

1. **Book of History:** a set of texts documenting the emperors’ deeds and dance pieces for the Zhou royal court (from 3000 BCE to 700 BCE).
2. **Book of Poetry:** a collection of poems made during the Zhou period.
3. **Book of Changes:** a book consisting of a divination system that explains the patterns in the universe.
4. **Book of Rites:** a book composed of rules used in court ceremonies and rites.
5. **Spring and Autumn Annals:** a set of historical records that discussed Confucius and the state of Lu.

On the other hand, the latter is made up of the following books:

1. **Analects:** sayings and speeches from Confucius, which have been recorded by his students.
2. **Great Learning:** a book explaining what constitutes a noble person; and the nature of education, morality, and politics.
3. **Doctrine of the Mean:** a text discussing the connection between human nature and the *Way of Heaven*.
4. **Mencius:** a set consisting of lessons by Mencius.[^mencius]

Confucianism was divided into different forms known as “schools” after interacting with *rival* or non-Confucian schools.

| Confucian Schools    | Non-Confucian Schools |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| *schools of Mencius* | *Mohist school*       |
| *Xunzi* (*Hsun Tzu*) | *Legalist school*     |
| *Neo-Confucians*     | *Taoism*              |

The question “Are humans inherently good or bad?” underlies the extent in which the government intervenes in human affairs: if humans are inherently good, less government intervention is needed since they are inclined to do good actions; however, if they are inherently bad, more is needed to achieve social harmony. Both Confucian and Non-Confucian Schools deal with the question in a myriad of ways.

For instance, Confucian schools believe that humans are born good, and, as such, Mencius argued that they are required to study the Confucius classics to protect their goodness from corruption. On the contrary, Xunzi thought that humans are born bad; thus, humans need to study the Confucius classics to change their bad nature.

### Key Elements of Confucian Ethics

Confucian ethics refer to Confucian ethical traditions before Neo-Confucianism. It is also known as *Classical Confucianism* because it is attributed to the views of Confucius; as elaborated by his two disciples: Mencius and Xunzi. Most of it was taken from the *Analects*, *Mencius*, and *Xunzi*.

Confucian ethics centered around the cultivation of one’s character to become a *junzi*. Confucius developed a framework to determine the types of virtues needed to become one. Lastly, some virtues—which are later identified—are also necessary for a junzi to possess (Confucian virtues).

#### The *Junzi*

The term [[junzi]] can roughly be translated into a “noble person”. Initially, only a person born in an aristocratic family can become a junzi; however, Confucius changed it to hinge on the individual’s character/conduct instead of their lineage. Anyone, as a result, can become a junzi—a term used for a morally excellent person.

In contrast, *xiaoren* roughly translates to “small-spirited person”, and was used to signify people outside of the aristocratic class. The term, nevertheless, was changed alongside junzi, and now refers to a morally petty person. For this reason, even a person of noble birth can become a *xiaoren*.

Some scholars adds to the definition of junzi using the three stages of moral excellence: the apprentice, the junzi, and the sage. The apprentice refers to a person attempting to become a junzi, while a junzi is a person attempting to become a sage or a *shengren*.

> [!INFO] Requirements to be a Sage
> 1. One must be a junzi.
> 2. One must know what a junzi is, and its importance.
> 3. One must guide others to the path of becoming a junzi.

#### The Mandate of Heaven

The Confucian moral framework consists of both naturalist and social elements. The [[Mandate of Heaven|mandate of heaven]] (*tien-ming*) represents the naturalist aspects of the framework, while the roles existing in a different relationships represents its social aspects. Consequently, a junzi pertains to a person who conforms to the mandate of heaven by accomplishing their roles in their various relationships.

As opposed to the prior understanding of the term “mandate of heaven”, Confucius only described heaven (or *tien*) as a place that preserves the universe’s moral order, and guides humans to moral excellence. This concept presupposes that heaven represents the *natural moral order*; hence, it entails that moral order is a natural part of the world—not social-constructs.

Confucius—despite not describing the nature of heaven—contends that we can learn the ways of heaven, especially by studying history (e.g., how and why empires rose and fell). For this reason, junzis’ were required to study the Confucian classics.

#### The Five Basic Relations

Confucius believed that humans are inherently social in nature—they will always be in a relationship with other humans. It was in this regard that junzi’s only achieve moral excellence with respect to their social relations. Confucius enumerated five basic types of relationships that can exist in human relationships.

> [!INFO] Five Basic Types of Human Relationships
> 1. Parent-Child
> 2. Husband-Wife
> 3. Ruler-Subject
> 4. Elder Sibling-Younger Sibling
> 5. Friend-Friend

Each party in the relationship have equal responsibilities—which, when achieved, result in a harmonious relationship. More advanced relationships emerging from the basic types (e.g., student-teacher, doctor-patient) will also possess their own reciprocal duties. Furthermore, a society will only achieve harmony when all relationships within it are harmonious.

The principle of *rectification of names* describes the duty to know and perform one’s responsibilities in a relationship—with *names* pertaining to one’s role in a particular relationship (such as, father, ruler, and etc.) Chaos arises when one fails to perform their duties, or performs duties inappropriate for their role (e.g., a leader acting like a businessman). It is important that names are clarified and match accordingly to what they signify. Negative social consequences arise when names are inaccurate or when usage of language is flawed: affairs would be problematic, inappropriate punishments would be carried out, and so on.

Confucius identified key virtues needed in the five basic relations (so that they can perform their respective duties based on their *names*):

| Type of Relationship          | Principal Virtue           |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Parent-Child                  | Intimacy                   |
| Husband-Wife                  | Reciprocity of Duties      |
| Ruler-Subject                 | Righteousness              |
| Elder Sibling-Younger Sibling | Respect based on Propriety |
| Friend-Friend                 | Fidelity                   |

#### The Confucian Virtues

Confucius discussed fundamental virtues which other virtues emerge from. Only *ren* and *li* are widely recognized as part of the *five cardinal virtues of Confucianism*, while the remaining three remains debated by different scholars. One version is shown in the table below

| Confucian Virtue | English Equivalent Term(s) |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| Ren              | humanity, benevolence      |
| Li               | propriety                  |
| Shu              | reciprocity                |
| Xiao             | filial piety               |
| Wen              | culture                    |

There are two ways to interpret the term **ren**. The first way views ren as a master virtue—achieving it entails that all other virtues are also achieved, and one is already a junzi. On the other hand, the second way interprets the term as pertaining to actions that promote the well-being of others.

In the context of Confucianism, **li** refers to virtue of acting appropriately given a situation; thus, one must properly speak, behave, and dress depending on the scenario faced. Li is the expression of Ren; benevolence need to be expressed, and right actions must have the right intentions. Both Li and Ren depend on each other; absence of one of the virtues results in them just becoming meaningless and empty concepts.

**Shu** refers to reciprocity, which the Golden Rule concisely explains: “Do not do unto others what you do not want others to do unto you.”

**Xiao** (or filial piety) is the virtue of showing love, respect, and devotion to one’s family members, especially to their parents. Furthermore, it also applies to the dead, thereby one ought to celebrate ancestral rites.

**Wen** deals with culture, specifically, the cultivation of one’s sense and appreciation of it. This is demonstrated in actions such as acquiring artistic skills and attending art exhibits.
