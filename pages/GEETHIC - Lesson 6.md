# Classical Virtue Ethics

Unlike [[consequentialism]] and [[deontology]], [[virtue ethics]] is primarily concerned with the character of a person instead of their actions. It focuses more on “What type of person I should be?” Rather than “What is the right decision?” Hence, motives behind an action is instrumental in assessing the *moral quality* of an act. The combination of **right action** and **right intention** is what makes a person virtuous.

## Aristotelian Ethics

[[Aristotelian ethics]] was taken from *Nicomachean Ethics*, which was written by Aristotle’s son, Nicomachus.[^a_ethics] For Aristotle, the good actions are ones that lead to *eudaimonia*—a virtue that is wanted for its own sake.

### Eudaimonia

[[Eudaimonia]] roughly translates to **happiness**, **well-being**, or **flourishing**. It is the end goal for all our actions. For us to attain it, we must fulfill our essence/nature by accomplishing our proper function.[^function] Because humans distinctly have the capacity to reason and act based on it, Aristotle believed that living in accordance with reason was our proper function. Therefore, we should let our rational faculty prevail over lower faculties (i.e., desire and passion) because we need it to achieve eudaimonia. Moreover, we ought to nurture our reasoning skills for the same reason.

### Concept of Virtue

[[virtue|Virtues]] enables us to fulfill our proper function, and, as such, Aristotle maintains that they are necessary for us to live a happy life. He categorized virtues into two types: *intellectual virtues* and *moral virtues*. The former allows us to reasonably think, while the latter enables us to rationally manage our emotions and desires.

Virtues are either learned through experience or acquired through habits. For instance, *practical wisdom* (an intellectual virtue) is learned through experience. On the other hand, justice, prudence, fortitude, and temperance are developed through habitual actions. This implies that moral virtues are not inherent in our nature, but it is formed through constant practice. For this reason, Aristotle referred to things which are intrinsic to our nature (e.g., our ability to see and hear) as *endowments*—to distinguish them from virtues.

Aristotle states that virtue comes from repeatedly doing the right thing; thus, it is internal process since it underscores the importance of building the right character. In contrast, *moral action* is an external exercise since it only focuses on the right decision. Although they are related, they are still different: one can do a good action while not necessarily being virtuous, and one can be virtuous and give in to performing an immoral act.

> [!QUOTE]- Quote Illustrating the Distinction Between Virtue and Moral Action
> A man who steals is not necessarily a thief; he stole, to be sure, and committed a misdeed, but a thief steals because it is his nature to do so. If an honest man steals, it is usually out of dire necessity, such as the avoidance of starvation, because everything is in him rebels against stealing. The same holds true of a good man who kills; he is not a murderer unless he murders by nature, that is, becomes a killer, but the person who by nature is not a killer may commit an isolated act of homicide purely in self-defence.

A *virtuous person* is one who enjoys doing *virtuous actions* because it became natural to them after constant practice. As Aristotle says, “A man who abstains from bodily pleasures and enjoys doing so is self-controlled; if he finds it troublesome, he is self-indulgent; a man who endures danger with joy, or at least without pain, is courageous; if he endures it with pain, he is a coward.” Aristotle believed that, in order to become virtuous, one must engage in moral actions with pleasure and contentment.[^eudaimonia]

### The Doctrine of the Mean

Although vice and virtue are similar (i.e., vice is also a product of habit and is enjoyable), Aristotle states that [[vice]] is either the *extreme of excess* or *extreme of deficiency* (with respect to character traits). On the other hand, virtue is the balance between either extremes. Aristotle sheds light on the positive effects of acting in accordance to the median, by comparing it to food—too much or too little will damage our health, while only consuming a proportionate amount will strengthen it. In the table below, Martin summarizes Aristotle’s discussed virtues with their corresponding excess, deficiencies, situation, and type of emotion.

| Kind of Situation          | Type of Emotion         | Excess Vice       | Virtue          | Deficiency Vice      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Responses to danger        | Fear, confidence        | Foolhardiness     | Courage         | Cowardice            |
| Satisfaction of appetites  | Physical pleasure       | Overindulgence    | Temperance      | Inhibition           |
| Giving gifts               | Desire to help          | Extravagance      | Generosity      | Miseliness           |
| Pursuit of accomplishments | Desire to succeed       | Vaulting ambition | Proper ambition | Unambitiousness      |
| Appraisal of oneself       | Self-confidence         | Vanity            | Proper pride    | Sense of inferiority |
| Self-expression            | Desire to be recognized | Boastfulness      | Truthfulness    | False modesty        |
| Responses to insults       | Anger                   | Irascibility      | Patience        | Apathy               |
| Social conduct             | Attitudes to others     | Obsequiousness    | Friendliness    | Rudeness             |
| Awareness of one’s flaws   | Shame                   | Shyness           | Modesty         | Shamelessness        |
| Conservation, humor        | Amusement               | Buffoonery        | Wittiness       | Boorishness          |

Nonetheless, Aristotle claims that the median is relative to the person, not the act. For example, it is courageous for a soldier to join the war; however, it is reckless for an ordinary citizen to do the same. Similarly, a weightlifter is sufficiently eating when consuming 10 pounds of food (since they require plenty of energy for their specialization), while eating the same amount for an ordinary person is considered too much.

Besides this, Aristotle also states that the model (found at the table shown previously) does not cover all types of cases. Cases involving actions and emotions that connote baseness do not have a mean. Adultery, in-nature, is wrong; there is no excess nor deficient adultery. Hence, a median does not exist for this action. This example illustrates how some things can never have a mean.

### Evaluating Aristotle’s virtue Ethics

A major criticism raised against Aristotelian ethics is the lack of clear instructions when it comes to specific moral issues. Although it greatly covers the character of an individual and its importance, it does not define which positions/actions are morally correct, such as in the case of abortion, death penalty, and etc.

[^a_ethics]: This was because he, presumably, edited his father’s work.
[^function]: For instance, a good car is one that can successfully and easily travel to a desired distance—which is their proper function.
[^eudaimonia]: I suppose that this might also be because doing the proper action should lead to fulfillment/eudaimonia.
