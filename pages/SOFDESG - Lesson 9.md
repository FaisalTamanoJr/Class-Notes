- [[documentation|Documentation]]
	- Describes an [[information system]] and helps the users, managers, and IT staff who must interact with it.
	- Benefits of accurate documentation
		- It can reduce system downtime.
		- It can cut costs.
		- It can speed up maintenance tasks.
	- Types
		- [[program documentation|Program documentation]]
			- It describes the inputs, outputs, and processing logic for all the program modules.
			- The program documentation process starts in the [[systems analysis]] phase and continues during the implementation.
			- This documentation guides programmers who construct modules that are supported by internal and external comments and descriptions.
		- [[system documentation|System documentation]]
			- It describes the system’s functions and how they are implemented.
			- It includes data dictionary entries, data flow diagrams, object models, screen layouts, source documents, and the systems request that initiated the project.
			- Most of the systems documentation is prepared during the [[systems analysis]] and [[systems design]] phases.
			- During systems implementation, an analyst must review the documentation to ensure that it is complete, up-to-date, and accurate (including any changes that was made during the implementation process).
		- [[operation documentation|Operation documentation]]
			- Operations documentation contains all the information needed for processing and distributing online and printed output.
			- Includes the following information:
				- Program, system analyst, programmer, and system identification.
				- Scheduling information for printed output, such as report run frequency and deadlines.
				- Input files and where they originate, and output files and destination.
				- E-mail and report distribution lists.
				- Special forms required, including online forms.
				- Error and informational messages to operators and restart procedures.
				- Special instructions, such as security requirements.
		- [[user documentation|User documentation]]
			- User documentation refers to the instructions and information to users. It includes user manuals, help screens, and tutorials.
			- Programmers or systems analysts usually create the program and system documentation.
			- You need someone with expert skills in this area doing the development, just as you need someone with expert skills developing the software.
- Management approval
	- After system testing is complete, you present the results to management.
	- You must provide detailed time schedule, cost estimate, and staffing requirements for making the system fully operational.
	- If system testing produced no technical, economical, or operational problems, management determines a schedule for system installation and evaluation.
- Training
	- A successful information system requires training for users, managers, and IT staff members.
	- The entire systems development effort can depend on whether or not people understand the system and know how to use it effectively.
- Vendor training
	- If the system includes the purchase of software or hardware, then vendor-supplied training is one of the features you should investigate in the [[Requests For Proposal]] (RFPs) and [[Requests For Quotation]] (RFQs) that you send to potential vendors.
	- The training is usually is conducted at the vendor’s site.
	- If a large number of people need training, you might need to arrange classes at your location.
- Outside training resources
	- If you have a standardized or customized package, vendor training is impractical, and your organization does not have the internal resources to perform the training, then seeking for outside training consultants may be a desirable alternative.
	- There are many available training consultants, institutes, and firms that provide standardized or customized training packages.
	- You can contact a training provider and obtain references from clients.
- In-house training
	- The IT staff and user-departments often share responsibility for developing and conducting training programs.
	- Examples of training methods that you can use
		- presentation software
		- key-stroke and mouse actions recorder
		- videotapes/screen recorder
		- charts
- [[system changeover|System changeover]]
	- System changeover is the process of putting the new information system online and retiring the old system.
	- Changeover methods
		- [[direct cutover|Direct cutover]]
			- a direct approach where old system is cut and overwrite by new system. The direct cutover approach causes the changeover from the old system to the new system to occur immediately when the new system becomes operational.
			- Involves more risk than other changeover methods because some difficulties can arise when the system goes into operation.
		- [[parallel cutover|Parallel cutover]]
			- The parallel operation changeover method requires that both the old and the new information systems operate fully for a specified period.
			- Data is inputted into both systems, and the output they generate will be compared.
		- [[pilot operation|Pilot operation]]
			- The pilot operation changeover method involves implementing the complete new system at a selected location of the company.
			- The group that uses the new system first is called the [[pilot site]].
			- The rest of the organization continue to use the old system.
		- [[phased operation|Phased operation]]
			- The implementation of the new system is carried out in modules or stages.
			- This is a combination of direct and parallel cutover, similiar to pilot operation. But in this approach, parts of the new system is provided to all users (instead of the entire new system being provided to some users).
- Post implementation tasks
	- A [[post-implementation evaluation]] assesses the overall quality of the information system.
	- The evaluation verifies that the new system meets specified requirements, complies with user objectives, and achieves the anticipated benefits.
	- Evaluation also helps improve IT development practices for future projects.
- Final report to management
	- The final report should include the following
		- A comparison of actual costs and schedules to the original estimates.
		- Post-implementation evaluation, if it has been performed.
	- The final report to the management marks the end of the systems development work.
