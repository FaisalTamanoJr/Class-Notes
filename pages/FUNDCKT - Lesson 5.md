# [[source transformation|Source transformation]]

Source transformations can help simplify circuits by allowing us to substitute a voltage source in series with a resistor for a current source in parallel with a resistor, or vice versa

![[independent source transformation.png|400]]

- These two circuits are equivalent and have equal resistance $$\begin{align}v_{s}=i_{s}R && ; && i_{s}=\frac{v_{s}}{R}\end{align}$$

- This process is applicable to both independent and dependent sources
- It does not affect the remaining part of the circuit
- The arrow of the current source is directed to the positive terminal of the voltage source

## Cases when source transformation is not possible:

1. Replacing an ideal voltage source ($R=0$)
2. Replacing an ideal current source ($R=\infty$)
