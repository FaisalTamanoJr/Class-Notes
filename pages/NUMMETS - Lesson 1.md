- # Introduction
	- Simple model (linear solution) → Complex model (nonlinear)
	- ## [[analytical methods|Analytical methods]]
		- Analytical methods use pure math equations to produce answers that are always correct but also may not be possible or is extremely difficult to obtain.
		- Before computers, analytical or exact methods were used to solve problems. Graphical solutions, without the aid of computers, were also used; however, they were slow, tedious, and imprecise.
	- ## [[numerical methods|Numerical methods]]
		- Numerical methods formulate problems solvable by arithmetic operations to approximate solutions (iterative calculations); as a result, it can be easier than analytical methods.
		- They, alongside computers, provided an alternative to complicated calculations.
- # Mathematical modeling and engineering problem solving
	- Mathematical modeling and engineering problem solving requires an understanding of engineering systems through observations, experiments, theoretical analyses, and generalizations. For this reason, computers can only be useful when users have a fundamental understanding of engineering problems.
	- ## Simple mathematical model
		- This model can be represented as a relationship described by the form:
			- $\text{Dependent variable}=f(\text{independent variables},\text{parameters},\text{forcing functions})$
				- $\text{Dependent variable}$: Characteristics that usually reflect the state of the system.
				- $\text{Independent variables}$: Dimensions which determines the system’s behavior.
				- $\text{Parameters}$: Reflects the system’s properties.
				- $\text{Forcing functions}$: External influences that affect the system.

- # Programming and software
	- ## Packages and programming
		- You can use [[Excel]] or [[MATLAB]] to perform numerical methods in problem solving.
		- You can become a power user by learning to write Excel VBA macros or MATLAB M-files.
	- ## Structured programming
		- Structured programming provides good style habits for programmers.
		- To develop, test, and update programs in a shorter period of time, use well-structured algorithms.
		- Structured programming relies on the idea that any numerical algorithm is made up of three fundamental control structures: sequence, selection, and repetition. Flowcharts and psuedocodes are usually employed to illustrate those algorithms.
	- ## Modular programming
		- Modular programming involves computer programs which can be divided into smaller modules, allowing for separate development and testing.
			- As a result, it makes it easier for the developers and users to understand the underlying code.
			- In addition, it allows different programmers to work on individual parts for larger projects.
			- Because errors are easier to isolate, modular design also simplifies the debugging and testing process.
			- Adding new modules to an already coherent and organized scheme also becomes easier.
	- ## [[Excel]]
		- Excel has some built-in numerical features including equation solving, curve fitting, and optimization. It also has VBA as a macro language for performing numerical calculations, and several visualization tools that can supplement the numerical analysis.
	- ## [[MATLAB]]
		- MATLAB makes it easy to implement mathematical manipulations of matrices and a variety of numerical methods.
