[[business ethics|Business ethics]] is a study concerning the morality that involves business organizations and the activities of its workers.

# Why Business Ethics Matter?

Plenty of people question the role of ethics in business practice; as a result, there are two ways of approaching this issue:

1. The positive way
	- Provides reasons to justify the importance of ethics in business
2. The negative way
	- Responds to the objections against the application of ethics in business

## Moral Features of Business Acts

[[business|Business]] refers to the activity involving the production and sales of goods and services for the sake of profit. It comes in three forms:

1. [[entrepreneurship]]
2. [[partnership]]
3. [[corporation]]

Business is integral in society for reasons including the following:

1. it creates wealth that serve as a means for societies to maintain economic stability and political autonomy; and
2. it is one of the most pervasive elements in society, thereby members of society will inevitably be affected by and/or involved with it.

In terms of widespread effects in society, business

- influences our values and well-being;
- shapes our social policies; and
- significantly impact our natural environment.

Nonetheless, we ought to subject them to moral evaluation mainly because of their possession of morally relevant features, namely the following:

1. Business acts are performed by [[moral agent|moral agents]]; therefore, these agents should be held [[moral accountability|morally accountable]] for their actions. They possess [[rationality]]—the capacity to know and act freely—and, as such, also have moral duties.
2. Business acts can engender serious harm to humans; hence, they can appropriately be subjected to moral evaluation using a [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] approach.
3. Business acts can violate moral rights, which makes them appropriate for moral evaluation using [[deontology|deontological standards]].
4. Business acts can lead to unfair distribution of benefits and burdens, which makes them appropriate for moral evaluation under the standard of [[justice]].
5. Business acts can damage the environment, which makes them appropriate objects of moral evaluation using the principles found in [[environmental ethics]].

Even with these reasons, many still find business ethics objectionable; as a consequence, ethicists formulated relevant responses against these objections.
