- [[matter cycles|Material cycles]]
	- No matter is created nor destroyed, they are all cycled through the ecosystem. All of them are also composed of certain chemical elements and compounds.
	- Two main compartments: the reservoir and the sink.
		- Materials are cycled from the reservoir to the sink and from the sink to the reservoir.
- [[matter cycles]] in ecosystems
	- General phases
		- ![[matter cycles phases.jpeg|400]]
	- Types
		1. [[water cycle|Water (Hydrologic) cycle]]
			- Processes involved
				- [[evaporation|Evaporation]] - liquid water → water vapor.
					- Water vapor was formed due to the sun’s heat.
				- [[transpiration|Transpiration]] - evaporation from plants.
				- [[condensation|Condensation]] - water vapor → liquid water.
					- Cooling of water vapor to form clouds (tiny water droplets).
				- [[precipitation|Precipitation]] - water from air goes to land.
					- Rain, snow, and sleet.
				- [[infiltration|Infiltration]] - water moves into the soil.
				- [[percolation|Percolation]] - water flows downward through soil.
				- [[runoff|Runoff]] - water flows downwards across the surface.
		2. [[carbon cycle|Carbon cycle]]
			- Processes involved for $CO_{2}\text{ - }O_{2}$
				- [[producers]] (plants and algae) - $CO_{2}$ absorption by [[photosynthesis]].
					- Main products: $O_{2}$ and food molecules (glucose)
				- [[consumers]] - use $O_{2}$ to break down food molecules in cells ([[cellular respiration]]).
					- $CO_{2}$ is released and used in photosynthesis.
			- Other processes releasing $CO_{2}$
				- [[fermentation|Fermentation]] and decay of wastes and remains of plants and animals ([[cellular respiration]]).
				- Plants burned by natural causes, such as the ones caused by lightning or forest fires.
				- Open burning and incineration of carbon containing products (such as wood and agricultural wastes).
				- Use of fossil fuels (transportation and power generation).
			- Changes in $CO_{2}$ concentration in the atmosphere - variation in Earth’s temperature.
				- [[greenhouse effect|Greenhouse effect]] - [[global warming]].
		3. [[nitrogen cycle|Nitrogen cycle]]
			- Nitrogen is about 78% of the Earth’s atmosphere.
			- All living things require nitrogen. Although most organisms cannot use it in gaseous form, combining it with other elements to form organic compounds or fixed nitrogen \[e.g. proteins and nucleic acids(DNA and RNA)\] can make it usable.
			- Fixed nitrogen supply is limited; nonetheless, complex methods of recycling nitrogen already exists.
			- Organisms that play a huge role in the nitrogen cycle
				- [[Nitrogen-fixing bacteria]]
					- Fixes atmospheric nitrogen gas ($N_{2}$) to ammonia ($NH_{3}$) - [[nitrogen fixation reaction]].
						- $N_{2}+3H_{2}\to_{2}NH_{3}$
					- Some nitrogen-fixing bacteria are free-living in the soil, such as the [[Azotobacter]], [[Cyanobacter]], and [[Rhizobia]].
					- Plants in [[legume]] family contain Rhizobia in their roots that fix $N_{2}$ in [[nodules]].
						- Beans (monggo, snake beans, alfalfa, etc.), peanuts, clover, and others.
						- Crop rotation for soil enrichment.
				- [[decomposers]]
					- Refer to the bacteria and fungi that decompose dead animals and plants. They convert their organic nitrogen (found in proteins and nucleic acids) into [[inorganic ammonium]] ($NH_{4}^+$).
				- Nitrifying bacteria
					- Interconvert inorganic nitrogen molecules.
						- [[Nitrosomonas]] converts ammonium ($NH_{4}^+$) into nitrites ($NO_{2}^-$).
						- [[Nitrobacter]] converts nitrites ($NO_{2}^-$) into nitrates ($NO_{3}^-$).
					- Collectively known as [[nitrification]] processes.
				- Denitrifying bacteria
					- Converts [[nitrates]] $(NO_{3}^-)$ to [[nitrites]] ($NO_{2}^-$) and then to [[nitrogen gas]] ($N_{2}$).
					- From inorganic nitrogen to atmospheric nitrogen - [[denitrification]].
					- Denitrifying bacteria include
						- [[Pseudomonas]]
						- [[Thiobacillus]]
					- [[anaerobic bacteria|Anaerobic bacteria]], denitrification occurs only in **anaerobic conditions**
			- Physical processes in the $N_{2}$ cycle
				- Lightning
					- Has high energy capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen to nitrates.
				- [[Haber-Bosch process]]
					- Artificial process that is used in manufacturing ammonium for fertilizers.
				- [[Leaching]]
					- Is the loss of nitrates from the soil due to heavy rain fall leaching into bodies of water (e.g. lakes).
					- Enrichment of lakes, causing [[algal bloom]] - [[eutrophication]].
			- Disruptions in the $N_{2}$ cycle
				- Some human activities can influence the nitrogen cycle, like human wastes in waterways, and agricultural runoff.
				- Industries fix large amounts of nitrogen to produce fertilizer, many of which is washed off from farmlands into waterways, resulting in the pollution of water.
				- The combustion of certain fuels produce nitrogen compounds, which also pollutes the air.
		4. [[oxygen cycle|Oxygen cycle]]
		5. [[phosphorus cycle|Phosphorus cycle]]
			- Phosphorus is added to land artificially by fertilizer \[ammonium phosphate, $(NH_{4})_{3}PO_{4}$\].
			- Dissolved phosphates are incorporated into aquatic plants, and passed to aquatic animals.
			- Re-entry to aquatic and terrestrial environment
				- Phosphorus are excreted directly by animals, such as bird droppings (fertilizer) from Guano.
				- Phosphorus is returned to the soil through the decay of plant and animal remains.
			- Disruptions in the phosphorous cycle
				- Accelerated weathering by clearing the forests for cultivated land, causing soil erosion.
				- The cycle is accelerated by mining phosphate rocks to manufacture products like fertilizers and detergents.
				- The use of phosphate-containing products increases the rate of phosphorous being returned to the sea.
		6. [[sulfur cycle|Sulfur cycle]]
			- Most sulfur is stored underground in igneous rocks and minerals such as pyrite ($FeS_{2}$). Moreover, it enters the atmosphere as hydrogen sulfide ($H_{2}S$), sulfur dioxide ($SO_{2}$), and sulfates.
			- Despite sulfur being a constituent of proteins, vitamins, and hormones, organisms obtain it from sulfates.
			- Sulfur gets released from weathering, and it gets exposed to aerobic conditions to become sulfates via oxidation.
			- DMS or [[dimethylsulfide]] is the gas released from the decomposition of phytoplanktons in the ocean. It is the largest natural source of sulfur in gas form; however, it has a residence time of only one day.
			- [[sulfates|Sulfates]] ($SO_4$) are anions whose metallic salts are highly soluble in water.
			- [[hydrogen sulfide|Hydrogen sulfide]] ($H_2S$) is a colorless, flammable, and poisonous gas. It usually comes from decaying dead organic matter in the absence of oxygen. It is obtained from the mineralization of organic sulfur, and the reduction of sulfates.
			- [[sulfur dioxide|Sulfur dioxide]] ($SO_2$) is another colorless gas and is the precursor to acid rain, usually, in the presence of $NO_{2}$ or other catalysts.
				- Acid rain is formed through the combination of water and sulfur dioxide.
			- [[sulfuric acid|Sulfuric acid]] ($H_{2}SO_{4}$) becomes acid rain when combined with rain or precipitation.
- [[biogeochemical cycles|Biogeochemical cycles]]
	- Also known as [[substance turnover]], [[cycling of substances]], or [[nutrient cycle]].
	- The chemical interactions that exist between the atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere.
	- It is a pathway by which a chemical moves through both the biotic (biosphere) and abiotic (atmosphere, lithosphere, and hydrosphere) compartments of Earth.
