- # Theory of ethics
	- Aspects of moral actions that are relevant when judging its quality ([[moral considerations]]):
		- its consequences
		- the rule that it follows/violates
			- An action is considered good when it follows a good rule—which can be understood as a rule that conforms to the will of God, respects moral rights, or conforms to the natural order of things—or it does not conform to a bad rule
		- the character of its [[moral agent|agents]]
			- An action can also be good or bad depending on whether it is something a [[virtuous person]] would do or something a [[vicious person]] would do
	- Three ethical theories are distinguished based on which [[moral considerations|moral consideration]] they believe is fundamental and should prevail over others
		- [[consequentialism]] - believes that **consequences** should prevail over the other aspects
		- [[deontology]] - believes that the **rule followed/violated** should prevail over others
		- [[virtue ethics]] - believes that the **character** of its agent should prevail over others
	- When one moral consideration is fundamental, it entails that the moral goodness of an action is independent of the other moral considerations.
- # [[consequentialism|Consequentialism]]
	- It claims that the consequences of an action are the parts that ultimately matter when evaluating its quality
	- The only consequences that matter in this ethical theory are the ones that involve an [[intrinsic good]]
	- ## Intrinsic and instrumental good
		- Intrinsic good, also known as [[inherent good]] and [[unconditional good]] refers to the good that is good in itself or is desirable for its own sake (e.g. happiness)
		- On the other hand, [[instrumental good]], also known as [[derived good]] and [[conditional good]], pertains to the good that is desired for the sake of something else (e.g. things desired to be happy)
