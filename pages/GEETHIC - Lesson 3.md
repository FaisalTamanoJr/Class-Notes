- # Theory of ethics
	- Aspects of moral actions that are relevant when judging its quality ([[moral considerations]]):
		- its consequences
		- the rule that it follows/violates
			- An action is considered good when it follows a good rule—which can be understood as a rule that conforms to the will of God, respects moral rights, or conforms to the natural order of things—or it does not conform to a bad rule
		- the character of its [[moral agent|agents]]
			- An action can also be good or bad depending on whether it is something a [[virtuous person]] would do or something a [[vicious person]] would do
	- Three ethical theories are distinguished based on which [[moral considerations|moral consideration]] they believe is fundamental and should prevail over others
		- [[consequentialism]] - believes that **consequences** should prevail over the other aspects
		- [[deontology]] - believes that the **rule followed/violated** should prevail over others
		- [[virtue ethics]] - believes that the **character** of its agent should prevail over others
	- When one moral consideration is fundamental, it entails that the moral goodness of an action is independent of the other moral considerations.
- # [[consequentialism|Consequentialism]]
	- It claims that the consequences of an action are the parts that ultimately matter when evaluating its quality
	- The only consequences that matter in this ethical theory are the ones that involve an [[intrinsic good]]
	- ## Intrinsic and instrumental good
		- Intrinsic good, also known as [[inherent good]] and [[unconditional good]] refers to the good that is good in itself or is desirable for its own sake (e.g. happiness)
		- On the other hand, [[instrumental good]], also known as [[derived good]] and [[conditional good]], pertains to the good that is desired for the sake of something else (e.g. things desired to be happy)
		- Consequentialism asserts that everyone should act in a way that results to the greatest amount of intrinsic good.
			- Between two conflicting actions that both result into a good consequence(s), the act with the greater good consequence(s) is the morally good act
			- Between two actions that both result into a bad consequence(s), the one with the lesser bad consequence(s) is the morally good act
			- Between two actions that both result into a combination of a good and bad consequence(s), the act with the greater net total of good consequence(s) is the morally good act
			- To get the aggregate good consequences of each alternative action, we get all the consequences of an action, and then subtract it by the total bad consequences
	- ## Types
		- ### [[hedonism|Hedonism]]
			- [[hedonistic consequentialism|Hedonistic consequentialism]] or hedonism believes that happiness is the only intrinsic good and pain is the only intrinsic bad.
			- The term *hedonism* was derived from the Greek word *hedone*, which meant pleasure
			- Hedonists justify their claim by stating that we cannot escape pain and pleasure, and even if we try to, we will eventually end up using them for our standards
				- An argument against this is the mere fact that it is meaningful to ask “is pleasure good?”—if pleasure and good were equal then it would be meaningless to ask this question since it would be the same as asking “is pleasure pleasure“. This argument is referred to as the open-question argument by G.E. Moore
				- Another argument states that an action that provides pleasure may not necessarily be desirable. This implies that it is not an [[inherent good]] because there are certain cases where it is not desirable.
		- ### [[non-hedonism|Non-hedonism]]
			- [[non-hedonistic consequentialism|Non-hedonistic consequentialism]] or non-hedonism is characterized by its rejection of hedonism, which comes in two ways:
				- The first view rejects the notion that pleasure is an intrinsic good. This version is referred to as [[exclusive non-hedonism]]. This type of non-hedonism believes that intrinsic good is power, desire/satisfaction, and etc.
				- The second view rejects the idea that pleasure is the only intrinsic good. This version is referred to as [[inclusive non-hedonism]]. This type of non-hedonism believes that there are other intrinsic goods (e.g., knowledge, power, beauty, freedom, desire-satisfaction, healthy relationships, and etc.)
		- ### Agent relativity and neutrality
			- [[agent-relative consequentialism|Agent-relative consequentialism]] or [[egoistic consequentialism]] claims that the only consequences that are worth morally evaluating are the ones that are agent-related (affects the agent)
			- [[agent-neutral consequentialism|Agent-neutral consequentialism]] or [[impartial consequentialism]] claims that both agent-related and non-agent-related consequences morally matter
				- In this type of consequentialism, everyone affected by an action gets equal consideration during the evaluation of an act’s morality
				- It claims that the morally good action is the one whose consequences produces the greatest amount of good
		- ### Complex forms and representatives
			- Four combinations of different types of consequentialism:
				1. [[agent-relative consequentialism|Agent-relative]] [[hedonism]] - an action is morally good if it gives the maximum pleasure to its agent
				2. [[agent-neutral consequentialism|Agent-neutral]] [[hedonism]] - an action is morally good if it results in the maximum overall pleasure of everyone involved in an action
				3. [[agent-relative consequentialism|Agent-relative]] [[non-hedonism]] - an action is morally good if it gives the maximum benefits to its agent
				4. [[agent-neutral consequentialism|Agent-neutral]]  [[non-hedonism]] - an action is morally good if it results in the maximum overall benefits for everyone involved in the action
			- Good ethical theories for [[agent-relative consequentialism|agent-relative]] [[hedonism]]:
				- Pleasures are classified as either [[active pleasure|active]]—characterized by the gratification of a specific desire—or [[passive pleasure|passive]]—characterized by the absence of pain
				- [[Cyrenaicism]] ([[active hedonism]]) - an ethical theory by [[Aristippus]] focusing on maximizing **short but intense** pleasure of an agent (sensory pleasures).
					- Life’s uncertainty and shortness gives rise to the sense of urgency to exhaust all pleasures one can while they are still alive. Nevertheless, Aristippus also says that we should be in control of our pleasures and not the other way around (because excess pleasure leads to pain and the limitation of desires is a condition of their satisfaction).
				- [[Epicureanism]] ([[passive hedonism]]) - an ethical theory by [[Epicurus]] focusing on maximizing **long but less intense** pleasure of an agent. It promotes freedom from pain in the mind and body.
					- Epicurus states that it is much more difficult to sustain the gratification of desires than the absence of pain.
					- He also states that it is useless to worry about divine future punishment because we will never know how God(s) thinks anyway.
					- He says that we should not worry about death because we still exists and we no longer exist when we die (meaning that it does not concern both the living and the dead)
			- Good ethical theories for [[agent-relative consequentialism|agent-relative]] [[non-hedonism]]:
				- [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] ethical theory - an exclusive form of hedonism that believes that power—the control over things—is the only intrinsic good, while things like happiness or pleasure are good only in so far as they enhance our *will to power* or the will to overcome life’s challenges. On the other hand, intrinsic evil pertains to all things that gives rise to weakness.
					- it is not entirely consequentialist but also contains some virtue ethics, as it also inspires us to develop our character to its noblest level (i.e., [[übermensch]], [[overman]], or [[superman]])
	- ## [[utilitarianism|Utilitarianism]]
		- The most influential [[agent-neutral consequentialism|agent-neutral]] form of consequentialism
		- It usually serves as a framework for decision making in economics, business, politics, and etc.
		- It is the foundation for most of the strategic decision-making methods that include [[cost-benefit analysis]], [[cost-effectiveness analysis]], [[subjective expected analysis]], and [[quality-adjusted life years analysis]]
		- Scholars criticize it for having the potential to justify injustices and rights violations when dealing with the maximization of aggregate good; however, proponents of this ethical theory argue that other moral concepts, like justice and rights, are only valuable in so far as they lead to the maximization of aggregate welfare ([[instrumental good]]).
		- ### Basic elements
			- #### Consequentialism
				- Utilitarianism determines the morality of an action based on its consequences
			- #### [[welfarism|Welfarism]]
				- Utilitarianism only considers an action morally relevant if they affect the welfare (or well-being) of people (in terms of benefits)
				- What [[welfare]] specifically refers to varies among proponents of utilitarianism, it can either be any of the following:
					- experience of pleasure and/or beauty
					- attainment of knowledge
					- fulfillment of desires and satisfaction
			- #### [[aggragationism|Aggragationism]]
				- The only welfare that utilitarianism considers morally relevant are the overall welfare of all people affected by a particular action
				- The action that yields the greatest net sum total of welfare is the morally good action
				- [[greatest happiness principle|Greatest happiness principle]] - “The greatest happiness of the greatest number of people”. It is commonly misunderstood as the happiness of the greatest number of people: it focuses more on the action that maximizes the amount of aggregate happiness rather than number of happy people.
				- It leads to impartiality because everyone’s pleasure is given equal consideration, including the agent
		- ### [[hedonism|Hedonistic]] forms of utilitarianism
			- This form of utilitarianism believes that pleasure is the only intrinsic good.
			- Its best form is represented by the ethical views of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]
				- Believes in the concept of utility, or the [[greatest happiness principle]], which sees the promotion of happiness (intended pleasure and absence of pain) as good and its opposition (pain and lack of pleasure) as bad. The morally good action is either the one that results to the greatest amount of pleasure or the one that results to the least amount of pain
				- **Bentham’s** views emphasizes the **quantitative** differences among the types of pleasures; thus, it is called as [[quantitative hedonistic utilitarianism]] or [[quantitative utilitarianism]].
					- It **does not** distinguish mental and physical pleasures
					- Bentham came up with a set of criteria called the [[calculus of felicity]] or [[hedonistic calculus]] to compute which pleasure one ought to choose. These includes the following:
						1. Intensity - the greater intensity of pleasure, the greater the value
						2. Duration - the longer the experience of pleasure, the greater the value
						3. Certainty - the greater the probability of the pleasure, the greater the value
						4. Propinquity (or remoteness) - the shorter the temporal distance, the greater the value
						5. Fecundity (the chance a sensation will be followed by sensations of the same kind) - the higher chances of pleasure being followed by another pleasure, the higher the value
						6. Purity (the chance a sensation will not be followed by sensations of the opposite kind) - the higher the chances of pain not following after pleasure, the greater the value
						7. Extent - the more people experiencing pleasure, the greater the value
					- Hedonistic calculus can also apply to pain; however, they are expressed as negative values. In addition, if an action results to both pleasurable and painful consequences, we can also find its net total through hedonistic calculus by subtracting the total amount of pain from the total amount of pleasure
				- **Mill’s** views emphasizes the **qualitative** differences among the types of pleasure; thus, it is called as [[qualitative hedonistic utilitarianism]] or [[qualitative utilitarianism]].
					- It distinguishes mental and physical pleasures
					- Mill’s response to objections to utilitarianism
						1. “Humans are no different from animals when they use pleasure and pain as a basis for their morality”. Mill responds to this objection by highlighting the distinction between mental and physical pleasure: [[rationality]] has a higher quality than [[sentience]]
						2. “Utilitarianism is bound to fail because there is no objective way to decide which type of pleasure is superior than others”. Mill responds by suggesting to use competent judges—people who experienced the entire spectrum of pleasure/pain or any relevant pleasures involved in a particular action
						3. “Utilitarianism cannot account for the moral goodness of acts of martyrdom/self-sacrifice”. Mill responds by pointing out that utilitarianism is agent-neutral. In addition, he argues that self-sacrifice is not always morally good
		- ### [[non-hedonism|Non-hedonistic]] forms of utilitarianism
			- Types:
				- [[exclusive non-hedonism|exclusive non-hedonistic]] utilitarianism - pleasure and pain are not intrinsically good and bad
				- [[inclusive non-hedonism|inclusive non-hedonistic]] utilitarianism - pleasure and pain are one of the things that are intrinsically good and bad
			- [[preference utilitarianism|Preference utilitarianism]] or ([[satisfaction utilitarianism]]) - most influential representative of [[exclusive non-hedonistic utilitarianism]]
				- It argues that we should maximize the satisfaction of our preferences (desires/interests) instead of pleasure/happiness; therefore, the morally good action is the one that results to the most satisfaction of preferences for the most number of people
				- [[preference balancing]] - the weighing of the relative strengths of the preferences involved in a given situation. This can be done through empathetical reasoning
			- [[pluralistic utilitarianism|Pluralistic utilitarianism]] or ([[ideal utilitarianism]]) - most influential representative of [[inclusive non-hedonistic utilitarianism]]
				- Aside from pleasure, the other intrinsic goods include beauty, knowledge, power, and healthy social relationships; consequently, the morally good action is one that results to the maximization of any of these intrinsic goods for the most amount of people
				- Cases that show how something can be desirable yet independent of pleasure:
					- Attitude towards a person in misery—it is appropriate and should be desired to feel sorrow
					- Beauty is desirable regardless of the pleasure one derives from contemplating it
		- ### [[act utilitarianism|Act utilitarianism]]
			- It contends that the principle of maximizing the aggregate good should be applied to the act itself; therefore, judging an action’s moral quality is dependent on the consequences of that action
			- Criticisms by [[rule utilitarianism|rule utilitarians]]:
				- Act utilitarians can justify not adhering to contracts by arguing that adherence to it does not serve the greatest good. For example, when you use the money for paying the barber who cut your hair to not pay them but instead donate to charity so that you can maximize goodness for the most amount of people
					- Rule utilitarians have an [[optimfic rule]] to honor contracts so that they can avoid this issue
		- ### [[rule utilitarianism|Rule utilitarianism]]
			- It contends that the principle of maximizing the aggregate good should be applied to the rule governing the act; therefore, judging an action’s moral quality is dependent on which rule the action followed
				- For this reason, some view this as the compromise between deontology and utilitarianism
			- [[optimfic rule|Optimfic rule]] - a good rule, meaning that it generally produces the maximum aggregate good or welfare
			- A good act is one that follows an optimfic rule. A bad one is one that does not.
			- Criticisms by [[act utilitarianism|act utilitarians]]:
				- Rule utilitarianism can lead to rule worship, in which a rule is followed for the sake of following it even if it will not lead to the best consequences
		- ### Complex forms of utilitarianism
			- The complex forms are combinations of the two general divisions of utilitarianism: [[hedonism]] and [[non-hedonism]], and [[act utilitarianism]] and [[rule utilitarianism]]. The combinations are the following:
				1. [[hedonism|Act hedonistic]] [[act utilitarianism|utilitarianism]] ([[classical utilitarianism]]) - an action is morally good if it maximizes aggregate happiness
				2. [[hedonism|Rule hedonistic]] [[rule utilitarianism|utilitarianism]] - an action is morally good if it follows a rule which generally results in the greatest amount of aggregate happiness
				3. [[non-hedonism|Act non-hedonistic]] [[act utilitarianism|utilitarianism]] - an action is morally good if it maximizes aggregate [[welfare]]
				4. [[non-hedonism|Rule non-hedonistic]] [[rule utilitarianism|utilitarianism]] - an action is morally good if it follows a rule which generally results in the greatest amount of aggregate [[welfare]]
