# Introduction to the Global Society

## Sources

1. The Globalization of World Politics by John Baylis, Steve Smith, and Patricia Owens (Chapter 1)

## Introduction

- *World politics* is a more inclusive term than *international relations* or *international politics*
	- International relations (or international politics) is limited to covering nation-states, while world politics also covers other structures (i.e., organizations that may not be states, such as, transnational terrorist groups, NGOs, and etc.).

### International Relations

International relations deal with

- the most urgent problems affecting most people, such as the pandemic and global environmental threats;
- controversial topics like power, violence, and inequality;

It is also divided into various subfields, like international history and international security. In addition, there are specialisms based on particular locations.

International relations is also very interdisciplinary, utilizing a variety of fields, including

- Political Science;
- History;
- Law;
- Geography; and more.

As an academic discipline, international relations was developed **relatively recently** for explaining parts of world politics.

- One historical account suggests that **it was made in 1919 to prevent a future war**. In this regard, the discipline is tasked to improve the existing conditions in the world.
- Others contend that it was established during the start of the twentieth century. Consequently, **it was initially made for to achieve colonialist and imperialist goals**, considering that world war, theft of land, and justifications for white supremacy marked this period.
	- To illustrate, one of the first international relations journal published was about the study of race development.
	- Scholars today argue against this by showing the multiple accounts of the disciplineâ€™s origin around the world.

One issue that international relations currently face is the past exclusion of women despite of their written contributions. For this reason, academics are still working to recover and analyze the lost works.
