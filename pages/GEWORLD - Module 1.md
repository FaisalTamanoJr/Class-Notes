# Introduction to the Global Society

## Sources

1. The Globalization of World Politics by John Baylis, Steve Smith, and Patricia Owens (Chapter 1)

## Introduction

- [[World politics]] is a more inclusive term than *international relations* or *international politics*
	- International relations (or international politics) is limited to covering nation-states, while world politics also covers other structures (i.e., organizations that may not be states, such as, transnational terrorist groups, NGOs, and etc.).

### International Relations

[[International relations]] deal with

- the most urgent problems affecting most people, such as the pandemic and global environmental threats;
- controversial topics like power, violence, and inequality;

It is also divided into various subfields, like international history and international security. In addition, there are specialisms based on particular locations.

International relations is also very interdisciplinary, utilizing a variety of fields, including

- Political Science;
- History;
- Law;
- Geography; and more.

As an academic discipline, international relations was developed **relatively recently** for explaining parts of world politics.

- One historical account suggests that **it was made in 1919 to prevent a future war**. In this regard, the discipline is tasked to improve the existing conditions in the world.
- Others contend that it was established during the start of the twentieth century. Consequently, **it was initially made for to achieve colonialist and imperialist goals**, considering that world war, theft of land, and justifications for white supremacy marked this period.
	- To illustrate, one of the first international relations journal published was about the study of race development.
	- Scholars today argue against this by showing the multiple accounts of the discipline’s origin around the world.

One issue that international relations currently face is the past exclusion of women despite of their written contributions. For this reason, academics are still working to recover and analyze the lost works.

## Main Theories of World Politics

When analyzing important political processes, avoid solely relying on history. You should also examine theories because they function as simplifying devices that guide you when determining which facts matter more over others.

Although

### Liberal Internationalism

[[Liberal internationalism]] was formed after World War 1—a period characterized by unstable empires competing and class conflict. The main ideas it puts forward include the following:

- Societies and humans have the capacity for improvement.
- *Capitalism* is the best system for managing the economy.
- Representative democracy is necessary for development.
- Ideas have value.

Liberals think that sometimes individuals and multinational organizations are the main actors of certain issue-areas of world politics. Moreover, they believe that individuals, with their collective social preferences, form the state (implying that the state is not a unitary actor.).

Liberals do not believe in *national interests* because they think that the government is made up of bureaucracies—a system of organization with non-elected officials—with each one having their own interests. Therefore, either societal preferences or the bureaucratic organizations influence the nation’s decision making process.

Liberals are also very supportive of cooperation among states, which are facilitated through *international institutions*.

From their perspective, world politics revolves around a system of bargaining between various types of actors. This would involve laws and rules, international regimes, and agreed norms. For this reason, this view highlights the importance of **interdependence between states** in world politics, especially considering its role in affecting the order of the global economy.

In contrast to realism, this view downplays the sovereignty aspect of states. Although states are legally sovereign, they still need to negotiate with a myriad of public and private actors.

### Realism

[[Realism]] asserts that the most powerful states, which are legally sovereign, mainly control the world stage. Because they are sovereign actors, no other actors above the state (e.g., international organizations and multinational corporations) can force them to change their decisions.

Realists view world politics as a struggle for power among states because they think that the inherent human selfishness govern the states’ decisions. Order only arises for the *balance of power*, in which states act to prevent other states from dominating. Furthermore, *diplomacy* is practiced by states to balance national interests among different states. When there is a conflict of interest, however, states will use their military force to implement their foreign policies.

A variant known as [[neorealism]] was developed in the 1980s. It underscored the influence of international systems’ structure in affecting the behavior of all states. For instance, the two main powers dominated the international system during the Cold War; consequently, they controlled the rules of behavior for all states. World politics, however, is currently headed towards multipolarity, which neorealists believe will have rules different from the previous phase (unipolarity).
