# Electrical Machines

- Electrical Machines are devices that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa
	- Types of electric machines:
		- **Electric Generator:** converts mechanical energy into electrical
		- **Motor:** converts electrical energy into mechanical
		- **Transformer:** power systems use it to either step up or step down ac voltages/currents
- Mutual Inductance
	- Two loops are magnetically coupled when they affect each other through a magnetic field generated by one of them.
	- Mutual inductance occurs when two coils (or inductance) are close to each other. One of the coil’s magnetic flux, caused by their current, links with the other coil; as a result, it generates voltage in the latter. ==In other words, mutual inductance is the quantity—measured in henrys (H)—referring to the capacity of an inductor to induce voltage to a neighboring inductor.==
		- Thus, the two inductors are magnetically coupled with each other.
	- If a current *enters* the dotted terminal of one coil, the reference polarity of the mutual voltage is *positive* at the dotted terminal of the second coil.
	- If a current *leaves* the dotted terminal of one coil, the reference polarity of the mutual voltage is *negative* at the dotted terminal of the second coil.
	- If the current enters the same terminals or dots, the coils’ total inductance is an example of *series-aiding connection* (positive voltage); otherwise, it is an example of *series-opposing connection* (negative voltage if the dot is at the bottom).
	- The dot, alongside the dot convention, is used to determine the polarity of the mutual voltage
- Transformers
	- Generally, it is a four-terminal device that is made up of 2+ magnetically coupled cois. They use magnetically coupled coils to transfer energy from one circuit to another
- Coupling coefficient
	- $k$, or the coupling coefficient, is the measure of magnetic coupling
	- $0\leq k\leq1$
- Ideal transformer
	- Has perfect coupling
	- Has 2 or more coils wrapped around a common core , which has high permeability
	- The high permeability causes the flux to link all turns, resulting in a perfect coupling
	- primary and secondary coils have infinete self-inductances
	- step-down transformer
		- secondary voltage < primary voltage
	- step-up transformer
		- secondary voltage > primary voltage
- Autotransformer
	- Has a continuous winding with a tap between the primary and secondary sides. The tap allows for desired turns ratio for stepping up or stepping down the voltage
	- It is a transformer in which both the primary and the secondary are in a single winding.

> 1. If inductance, multiplty by $j\omega$, thus $j\omega MI$
