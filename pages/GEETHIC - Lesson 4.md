# Introduction
- The term [[deontology]] is derived from the Greek word [[deon]], which means duty
- This ethical theory emphasizes the relationship between duty and the morality of an action
- # [[divine command theory|Divine command theory]]
	- This theory contends that religion should be used as the basis for morality
	- It is not recommended for polytheistic religions because their Gods do not always agree with each other (conflicting divine wills) and because they (some polytheistic religions) consider some of their Gods evil
	- ## Basis of morality
		- Divine command theory states that **what is good is only good because God wills it**. Our life’s purpose is to live according to what God wills because we came from him; in other words, being morally good is right because we fulfill what we were made for.
			- Those who support this theory believe in either the [[strong version of the divine command theory]] or the [[weak version of the divine command theory]]
				- The **strong version** claims that something is right only when God commands it and something is wrong only when God forbids it. Morality is founded on God’s commands and not through reasoning.
					- This implies that when there is no God, there is no morality ([[moral nihilism]]), life is meaningless, and nothing has intrinsic value
					- The required three theses of the strong version:
						1. Morality comes from God
						2. Moral rightness means “willed by God” while moral wrongness means “forbidden by God”
						3. Because morality is based on divine will, other forms of reasoning are unnecessary
				- The **weak version**, or as Soren Kierkegaard calls it, the [[teleological suspension of the ethical]], omits/qualifies one or two of the three theses of the divine command theory’s strong version. Despite it maintaining that ethics has an independent foundation (i.e., reason), God’s commands still supersede it when they are conflicting with each other.
					- This implies that the absence of God does not entail the absence of morality
	- ## Criticism
		1. How can we know of God’s will if there are too much people that have different ideas of it
			- It is irrational to believe that one group knows God’s genuine commands better than any other group
			- God’s commands with respect to a particular issue is sometimes too vague; for this reason, many moral issues are polarizing even among people under the same faith.
			- Some people claim that God directly communicated their will to them through a [[messenger wind]]
			- There are too many varying claims regarding God’s will that are often contradictory and cannot be satisfyingly resolved
		2. It leads to moral arbitrariness
			- If God’s will is the only basis for morality, then God could command us to violate the rights of others and it would still be the morally correct action
				- Nevertheless, Robert Adams and other philosophers argue that this cannot be the case since ordering us to do something cruel for its own sake is contrary to the notion of God being loving, allowing us to disobey him
					- The argument posed against this defense stated that using love as a criterion presupposes that it is independent of God and stands above his commands—good actions are not good solely because of divine will
		3. Human reason is rendered useless
			- We deprive our ourselves of our [[rationality]] when we only use God’s commands to decide for us
			- Strict adherence to God’s will is challenged when it contradicts with human reason
	- ## God’s significance in morality
		- Some thinkers still maintain that God is essential in morality despite disagreeing with the notion that morality is based on religion
			- They believe that God serves as the governmental authority who punishes wrong actions and rewards good actions; therefore, ensuring the existence of justice and provides a foundation for morality.
			- God’s existence entail that good will eventually prevail over evil
			- Although religion may not address the issue of what is moral and what is not (morality’s content), it still provides purpose for morality (morality’s motivation). In addition, religion also provides practices and structures to reinforce its values unlike atheist ethics.
