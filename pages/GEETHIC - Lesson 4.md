# Introduction
- The term [[deontology]] is derived from the Greek word [[deon]], which means duty
- This ethical theory emphasizes the relationship between duty and the morality of an action
- # [[divine command theory|Divine command theory]]
	- This theory contends that religion should be used as the basis for morality
	- It is not recommended for polytheistic religions because their Gods do not always agree with each other (conflicting divine wills) and because they (some polytheistic religions) consider some of their Gods evil
	- ## Basis of morality
		- Divine command theory states that **what is good is only good because God wills it**. Our life’s purpose is to live according to what God wills because we came from him; in other words, being morally good is right because we fulfill what we were made for.
			- Those who support this theory believe in either the [[strong version of the divine command theory]] or the [[weak version of the divine command theory]]
				- The **strong version** claims that something is right only when God commands it and something is wrong only when God forbids it. Morality is founded on God’s commands and not through reasoning.
					- This implies that when there is no God, there is no morality ([[moral nihilism]]), life is meaningless, and nothing has intrinsic value
					- The required three theses of the strong version:
						1. Morality comes from God
						2. Moral rightness means “willed by God” while moral wrongness means “forbidden by God”
						3. Because morality is based on divine will, other forms of reasoning are unnecessary
				- The **weak version**, or as Soren Kierkegaard calls it, the [[teleological suspension of the ethical]], omits/qualifies one or two of the three theses of the divine command theory’s strong version. Despite it maintaining that ethics has an independent foundation (i.e., reason), God’s commands still supersede it when they are conflicting with each other.
					- This implies that the absence of God does not entail the absence of morality
	- ## Criticism
		1. How can we know of God’s will if there are too much people that have different ideas of it
			- It is irrational to believe that one group knows God’s genuine commands better than any other group
			- God’s commands with respect to a particular issue is sometimes too vague; for this reason, many moral issues are polarizing even among people under the same faith
			- Some people claim that God directly communicated their will to them
