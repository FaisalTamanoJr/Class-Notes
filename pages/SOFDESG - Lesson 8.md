- File processing
	- File proccessing is a design approach suited for mainframe hardware and batch input.
	- It is less common today; however, it can be better than DBMS in certain situations.
	- Advantages
		- Simplicity
			- File processing is simpler than Database.
		- Efficiency
			- It cost less and can run faster than Database.
		- Customization
			- It is easier to customize than Database because the files are related with the application. Moreover, it has all the data needed for that application.
	- Types
		- Master file
			- Stores relatively permanent data about an entity.
		- Table file
			- Contains reference data used by the information system.
			- Are relatively static and are not updated by the information system.
		- Transaction file
			- Stores records that contain day-to-day business and operational data. It is an input file that updates a master file; after the update is completed, the transaction file has served its purpose.
		- Work file - scratch file
			- TODO
		- Security file
			- Sequence codes are numbers or letters assigned in a specific order. Sequence codes contain no additional information other than an indication of order of entry into a system.
		- History file
			- Is a copy created and saved for historical and archiving purposes. New history files, unlike new security files, do not replace the old files.
- Database systems
	- Database
		- A collection of groups of information that relate to each other in some way.
		- A properly design system offers a solution to the problems of file processing.
		- It provides a framework that avoids data redundancy and supports a real-time, dynamic environment.
		- Tradeoffs
			- Because DBMS are powerful, they require expensive hardware, software, and data networks capable of supporting a multi-user environment.
			- More complex than a file processing system.
			- Procedures for security, backup, and recovery are more complicated and critical.
	- Database management system (DBMS)
		- Is a collection of tools, features, and interfaces that enables users to add, update, manage, access, and analyze the contents of a database.
		- Advantages
			- Scalability/extensibility
				- Allows the system to easily be expanded, modified, or downsized to meet rapidly changing needs of a business enterprise.
			- Better support for client/server systems
				- TODO
			- Economy of scale
				- Refers to the inherent efficiency of high-volume processing on larger computers. Database design allows better utilization of hardware.
			- Flexible data sharing
				- Data can be shared across the enterprise, allowing more users to view the same information in different ways.
			- Enterprise-wide application - database administrator (DBA)
				- DBA typically manages a database management system (DBMS). The DBA assesses overall requirements and maintains the database for the benefit of the entire organization rather than a single department user.
			- Stronger standards
				- TODO
			- Controlled redundancy
				- Because the data is stored in a set of related tables, data items do not need to be duplicated in multiple locations.
			- Better security
				- TODO
			- Increased programmer productivity
			- Data independence
- Entity-relationship diagrams
	- A picture showing information created, stored, and used by a business system.
	- TODO
	- Representing entities
		- An entity is represented by a named rectangle
		- Use a singular noun, or adjective + noun
		- Refer to one instance in naming
	- Entity types and instances
		- An entity type is a classification of entity instances
	- Relationship
		- Is an association between two entities
		- We may wish to store information about the association
		- Relationships should have active verb names
		- TODO
		- A relationship type is a relevant business association between two entity types
		- A relationship is an occurence of a relationship type
	- Types of relationships
		- One to one relationship
			- One instance in an entity refers to one and only one instance in the related entity
		- One to many relationship
			- One instance in an entity refers to one or more instances in the related entity
		- Many to many relationship
			- Exists when one instance of the first entity can relate to many instances of the second entity, and one instance of the second entity can relate to many instances of the first entity
			- Associative entity, is the process to determine if the relationship is many to many.
	- Cardinality
		- Cardinality notation
			- The notation that shows relationships between entities
		- Crowâ€™s foot notation
			- A type of cardinality notation
			- TODO
