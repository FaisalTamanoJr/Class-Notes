- [[file processing|File processing]]
	- This approach was suited to mainframe hardware and batch input.
	- It is less common today, despite being more efficient and costing less than [[Database management system|DBMS]] in certain situations.
	- Advantages
		- Simplicity
			- Designing it is simpler than designing [[database|Database]].
		- Efficiency
			- It costs less and can run faster than [[Database]].
		- Customization
			- It is easier to customize than Database because the files are related with the application, and it has all the data needed for that application.
	- Types of files
		- [[master file|Master file]]
			- Stores relatively permanent data about an entity.
		- [[table file|Table file]]
			- Table files contain reference data used by the [[information system]].
			- They are relatively static and are not updated by the [[information system]].
		- [[transaction file|Transaction file]]
			- A transaction file stores records that contain day-to-day business and operational data.
			- It is an input file that updates a master file; the transaction file serves its purpose after it completes the update.
		- [[work file|Work file]] - [[scratch file]]
			- A work file is a temporary file used by the information system for a single task.
			- It is often created by one process and is used by another process within the same [[information system]].
		- [[security file|Security file]]
			- Sequence codes are numbers or letters assigned in a specific order, indicating the order of entry into a system.
		- [[history file|History file]]
			- A history file is a copy created and saved for historical and archiving purposes.
			- New history files, unlike new [[security file|security files]], do not replace the old files.
- [[database systems|Database systems]]
	- A properly designed database system offers a solution to the problems of [[file processing]].
	- It provides a comprehensive framework that avoids data redundancy and supports a real-time, dynamic environment.
	- Advantages
		- Scalability
			- Scalability refers to the capacity of the system to be expanded, modified, or downsized to meet rapidly changing needs of a business enterprise.
			- It is also known as extensibility.
		- Better support for client/server systems
			- In a client/server system, processing is distributed across an organization. For this reason, they need the power and flexibility of [[database]] design.
		- Economy of scale
			- Economy of scale refers to the inherent efficiency of high-volume processing on larger computers. Database design allows better utilization of hardware.
		- Flexible data sharing
			- Data can be shared across the enterprise, allowing more users to view the same information differently.
		- Enterprise-wide application - [[database administrator]] (DBA)
			- DBA typically manages a database management system (DBMS).
			- The DBA assesses overall requirements and maintains the database for the benefit of the entire organization rather than a single department user.
		- Stronger standards
			- Effective database administration helps ensure that standards for data names, formats, and documentation are followed uniformly throughout the organization.
		- Controlled redundancy
			- Because the data is stored in a set of related tables, data items do not need to be duplicated in multiple locations.
		- Better security
			- The [[database administrator|DBA]] defines authorization procedures to ensure that only legitimate users can access the database and can allow different users to have different levels of access.
		- Increased programmer productivity
			- Programmers do not have to create the underlying file structure for the database; instead, they can focus on its logical design.
		- Data independence
			- Systems that interact with a DBMS are relatively independent of how the physical data is maintained.
	- Tradeoffs
		- Because DBMSs are powerful, they require expensive hardware, software, and data networks capable of supporting a multi-user environment.
		- They are more complex than a file processing system.
		- Procedures for security, backup, and recovery are more complicated and critical.
	- [[Database]]
		- A collection of groups of information that relate to each other in some way.
	- [[database management system|Database management system]] (DBMS)
		- DBMS is a collection of tools, features, and interfaces that enables users to access, update, and analyze the contents of a database.
- [[entity-relationship diagrams|Entity-relationship diagrams]] (ERD)
	- A picture showing information created, stored, and used by a business system, including high-level business rules.
	- ERD is a network model that describes a system’s stored data at a high-level of abstraction.
	- Entities generally represent similar kinds of information.
	- Lines drawn between entities show relationships among the data.
	- Representing entities
		- An entity is represented as a named rectangle.
		- Use a singular noun, or adjective + noun.
		- Refer to one instance in naming.
	- Entity types and instances
		- An entity type is a classification of entity instances.
	- Relationship
		- A relationship is an association between two entities, which can store information.
		- Relationships should have active verb names.
		- They are often represented as a verb or “entity + verb + entity”.
		- A Relationship Type is a relevant business association between two entity types.
		- A relationship is an occurence of a relationship type.
	- Types of relationships
		- [[one-to-one relationship|One-to-one relationship]] (1:1)
			- One instance in an entity (parent) refers to one and only one instance in the related entity (child).
		- [[one-to-many relationship|One-to-many relationship]] (1:M)
			- One instance in an entity (parent)refers to one or more instances in the related entity (child)
		- [[many-to-many relationship|Many-to-many relationship]] (M:N)
			- A M:N relationship exists when one instance of the first entity (parent) can relate to many instances of the second entity (child), and one instance of the second entity can relate to many instances of the first entity
			- This relationship cannot be represented physically; therefore, it has to be divided into two 1:M relationships.
			- [[associative entity|Associative entity]] is the event or third entity that links two entities that are under a M:N relationship.
	- [[cardinality|Cardinality]]
		- [[cardinality notation|Cardinality notation]]
			- ![[cardinality notation.jpg|250]]
			- Cardinality notation serves as the notation to show the relationships between entities
		- [[crow’s foot notation|Crow’s foot notation]]
			- Crow’s foot notation is a common type of cardinality notation that is referred to as the “Crow’s foot notation” because of the shapes.
				- A single bar indicates one.
				- A double bar indicates one and only one.
				- A circle indicates zero.
				- A crow’s foot indicates many.
