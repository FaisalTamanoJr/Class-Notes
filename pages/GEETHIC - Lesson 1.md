- # [[ethics|Ethics]]
	- ## Ethics vs [[morality]]
		- Morality
			- Morality refers to the set of standards an individual possesses to determine what actions are right and wrong
			- It could also pertain to the norms in a particular society that members use as a basis for judging which actions are right and wrong
			- It is influenced by one’s social and cultural environment
		- Ethics
			- Ethics is the study examining the soundness and appropriateness of a particular person’s or society’s moral standard
	- ## Areas
		- ### [[metaethics|Metaethics]]
			- Metaethics, also known as [[analytic ethics]], looks into the nature, meaning, scope, and foundations of moral values and discourses
			- It attempts to understand the basic ideas, concepts, and assumptions that underlie our moral beliefs
			- It is occasionally  referred to as “second-order” moral theorizing, to distinguish it from the “first-order” level of normative theory
		- ### [[normative ethics|Normative ethics]]
			- Normative ethics is concerned with the moral standards to determine right from wrong conduct
			- It involves the formulation of moral norms/rules that can serve as the foundation for determining what actions are right and wrong
			- #### Theories on moral standards
				- [[consequentialism|Consequentialism]]  - focuses on consequences
				- [[deontology|Deontology]] - focuses on rules being followed/violated
				- [[virtue ethics|Virtue ethics]] - focuses on the character of the person performing the action
		- ### [[applied ethics|Applied ethics]]

			-  Using [[metaethics|metaethical]] and [[normative ethics|normative ethical]]  tools, applied ethics aims to analyze and clarify various ethical issues to guide our moral judgement
	- ## [[descriptive ethics|Descriptive ethics]]
		- Descriptive ethics is not an area of moral philosophy; it endeavors to present the moral norms that people believe in—not what people ought to do.
- # Nature of [[moral statements]]
	- It is important to understand the nature of [[moral statements]], or claims related to morality, to also understand how they should be evaluated
	- ## Moral statements as [[normative statements]]
		- Moral statements are considered normative statements rather than factual ones because they express a [[value judgement]]—a judgement that claims that something is *ought* to be (as opposed to a [[factual judgement]] that claims that something *is* the case. As a result, normative statements are evaluated based on standards/norms instead of empirical data.
		- A normative statement is a moral statement if it uses a moral standard as its basis for evaluation.
		- Empirical data or facts can support a moral statement but it is not enough; a certain moral standard(s) or principle(s) is necessary to form a moral conclusion.
