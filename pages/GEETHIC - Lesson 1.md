			- It is influenced by one’s social and cultural environment

			- It attempts to understand the basic ideas, concepts, and assumptions that underlie our moral beliefs
			- It is occasionally  referred to as “second-order” moral theorizing, to distinguish it from the “first-order” level of normative theory
		- ### [[normative ethics|Normative ethics]]
			- Normative ethics is concerned with the moral standards to determine right from wrong conduct

			-  Using [[metaethics|metaethical]] and [[normative ethics|normative ethical]]  tools, applied ethics aims to analyze and clarify various ethical issues to guide our moral judgement
	- ## [[descriptive ethics|Descriptive ethics]]
		- Descriptive ethics is not an area of moral philosophy; it endeavors to present the moral norms that people believe in—not what people ought to do.
- # Nature of [[moral statements]]
	- It is important to understand the nature of [[moral statements]], or claims related to morality, to also understand how they should be evaluated
	- ## Moral statements as [[normative statements]]
		- Moral statements are considered normative statements rather than factual ones because they express a [[value judgement]]—a judgement that claims that something is *ought* to be (as opposed to a [[factual judgement]] that claims that something *is* the case. As a result, normative statements are evaluated based on standards/norms instead of empirical data.
		- A normative statement is a moral statement if it uses a moral standard as its basis for evaluation.
		- Empirical data or facts can support a moral statement but it is not enough; a certain moral standard(s) or principle(s) is necessary to form a moral conclusion.
	- ## Moral statements and [[moral standards]]
		- Ethicists have identified characteristics that make a standard a moral one. Although these characteristics are not exclusive to a moral standard, if all characteristics are present in a particular standard, it is considered a moral standard. The characteristics are
			- deals with matters that can seriously harm or benefit human beings (they have to be able to govern our conduct)
			- have universal validity
			- people should think that they should prevail over other values
			- they are not established by decisions of authoritarian bodies nor appealing to the consensus/tradition.
- # [[morality|Morality]] and other normative subjects
	- ## Morality and [[etiquette]]
		- Etiquette are customs that determine the accepted behaviors in a particular group; following them shows respect and courtesy to others.
		- Etiquette differs from morality in a way that it is focused on proper behavior, while the latter is focused on correct conduct; therefore, etiquette is more culture-based and arbitrary.
			- This entails that violating a rule in etiquette is not immoral and following the etiquette is also not morally good
		- Etiquette can be rooted in something immoral or moral. Despite not being synonymous, they are related because they affect human action.
