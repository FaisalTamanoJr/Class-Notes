- Differences between [[environmental science]] and [[environmental engineering]]
	- **Environmental engineering** is the application of engineering principles to solve environmental issues, usually because of a recommendation provided by an environmental scientist.
	- **Environmental science** is the use of an integrated, quantitative, and interdisciplinary approach to the study of environmental systems.
- [[environmental engineering]]
	- In the past, environmental engineering was used to refer to the profession that uses mathematics and science to take advantage of the properties of matter and energy sources, and to use it to solve environmental sanitation issues. However, the definition has evolved to refer to the complex and multidisciplinary enterprise that embodies the complete spectrum of environmental effects on health and ecology.
	- Things involved with environmental engineering
		1. Provision of safe, palatable, and ample public water supplies.
		2. Proper waste management.
		3. Adequate drainage of urban and rural areas.
		4. Control of water, soil, and atmospheric pollution.
		5. Social and environmental impact of these solutions.
		6. Engineering problems in the field of public health.
		7. Elimination of industrial health hazards.
		8. Provision of adequate sanitation in urban, rural, and recreational areas.
		9. Effects of technological advances on the environment.
