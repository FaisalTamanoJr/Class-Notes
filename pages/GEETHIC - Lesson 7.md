# Distributive Justice

## Justice as a Virtue

[[Plato]] maintains that justice is the individual and state’s ultimate virtue. This can be achieved when all of their fundamental elements are effective and in harmony.[^harmony]

| Individual Soul | State             | Virtue     |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| Reason          | Rulers            | Wisdom     |
| Spirit/Passion  | Military/Soldiers | Courage    |
| Appetite/Desire | Merchants/Workers | Temperance |

[[Aristotle]] distinguishes justice in 2 senses:

1. **In a [[general sense of justice|general sense]] (lawfulness):** States try to cultivate good habits among citizens through its laws, and it is when all citizens abide by these laws that justice is achieved.
2. **In a [[particular sense of justice|particular sense]] (fairness):** Justice can also be achieved when states fairly distribute benefits and burdens among its citizens (distributive justice) and address existing injustices (corrective justice).

## Kinds of Justice

1. [[retributive justice|Retributive Justice]]
	- Refers to the fair imposition of punishments.
2. [[compensatory justice|Compensatory Justice]]
	- Refers to the fair way of compensating people.
3. [[distributive Justice|Distributive Justice]]
	- Refers to the fair allocation of benefits (e.g., income) and burdens (e.g., workload).
4. [[procedural justice|Procedural Justice]]
	- Refers to the fairness of the decision-making process (usually associated with [[due process]]).

## Theories of Distributive Justice

Distributive justice is the most fundamental kind of justice that underlies many of the other kinds; for example, punishments and compensations are forms of benefits and burdens, and a due process is just a standard for distribution/allocation.

When is the a distribution just?

| Distribution Basis                  | Theory of Justice                       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Equality                            | [[egalitarianism\|Egalitarianism]]      |
| Contribution                        | [[capitalism\|Capitalist]] Justice      |
| Needs                               | [[socialism\|Socialist]] Justice        |
| Effort                              | Justice as Fair Opportunity             |
| Maximum Aggregate Good              | [[utilitarianism\|Utilitarian]] Justice |
| Principles Fairly Chosen            | Justice as Fairness                     |
| Respect for Moral (Property) Rights | [[libertarianism\|Libertarian]] Justice |

1. [[egalitarian justice|Egalitarian Justice]]
	- [[political egalitarianism|Political Egalitarianism:]] equality of rights
	- [[economic egalitarianism|Economic Egalitarianism:]] equality of resources
	- [[luck egalitarianism|Luck Egalitarianism:]] inequalities may be fair or unfair; unfair inequalities come from factors outside of our control.
2. [[capitalist justice|Capitalist Justice]]
	- The greater the contribution, the greater the share in the distribution.
3. [[socialist justice|Socialist Justice]]
	- The greater the need, the greater the share in the distribution.
4. [[justice as fair opportunity|Justice as Fair Opportunity]]
	- The greater the effort, the greater the share in the distribution.
5. [[utilitarian justice|Utilitarian Justice]]
	- Any form of distribution is just as long as it promotes the maximum aggregate welfare for everyone involved.
6. [[justice as fair opportunity|Justice as Fairness]]
	- A distribution is just when it fairly follows the principles that everyone involved chose.[^fairness] John Rawls includes the following principles:
		- **[[principle of equality]]:** Basic rights and liberties should be equal.
		- **[[principle of fair inequality]]:** Socioeconomic inequalities should promote the interests of the least-advantaged citizens and provide equal opportunities for everyone.
7. [[libertarian justice|Libertarian Justice]]
	- The just distribution is one that respects the property rights of everyone involved in the distribution.

# Ethics of Care

## Overview of Care Ethics

[[care ethics|Care Ethics]] criticizes the rationalist and universalist approach of [[categorical imperative|Kantian]] and [[utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] theories for being distant from realistic moral experiences. Moreover, it differs from [[GEETHIC - Lesson 6|Aristotelian virtue ethics]] in a way that it tries to be less male-oriented in terms of its moral attributes.

Many associate it with feminist philosophy because women philosophers and psychologist developed it, thereby expressing the moral experiences of women. Nevertheless, some argue that it is universal because *care* is not exclusive to women.

Philosophers created it to address their criticisms of traditional moral theories, which include the following:

1. Traditional moral theories are designed for *interactions with autonomous strangers* (universality and impartiality), whereas this theory heavily emphasize the role of *preserving human relationships* in one’s moral life.
2. Traditional moral theories treat morality as objective/impartial and purely rational, while this feminist moral theory values the desire to care for others.

## Contributions of Gilligan and Noddings

There are plenty of contributors to care ethics; two of the earlier contributors were [[Carol Gilligan]] (a psychologist) and [[Nel Noddings]] (a feminist philosopher).

## Some Criticisms

[^harmony]: When effective and in harmony, one element can result in a virtue; whereas, if all elements were effective and in harmony, it results in justice.
[^fairness]: i.e., not biased to one’s situation
