## Distributive Justice

### Introduction

A fundamental part of organizations are their distribution system. Because it affects moral persons, the distribution method have a moral dimension which we can evaluate: it is morally good when it distributes fairly; otherwise, it is morally wrong.

[[distributive Justice|Distributive justice]] is an ethical theory that **investigates the essential features of a fair distribution**. It is considered a [[virtue ethics]] type of ethical theory because it focuses on the virtue of **justice**, in which humans and institutions are morally evaluated as agents of distribution.

### Foundations of Distributive Justice

#### Why We Ought to Treat Others Justly

- The idea that justice is a [[virtue]] underlies Aristotle and Plato’s theories of justice. Virtue is achieved when one performs their natural function well (e.g., a knife being useful for cutting).
- Aristotle contends that justice is divided into a general level—the level in which justice is a *system virtue*—and a particular level—the level where justice is an *individual virtue*.
- Plato, on the contrary, argues that justice can be a system virtue when the elements of a state or an individual’s soul harmoniously achieve their basic individual virtues.

> [!TIP]- Classifications of Virtues
> 1. **Individual virtue -** is achieved when a specific function is being done well.
> 2. **System virtue -** is achieved when all underlying functions within the system are being done well and harmoniously.

Plato believed that justice as a virtue can either be on an individual level or a social level (or state).

1. Individual level
	- The human body is composed of a body and a soul, with soul being the only inherent component.
	- When the body achieves its system virtue—functions of its elements (e.g., organs) are harmoniously and excellently performing—it manifests in the form of **health**.
	- When the soul achieves its system virtue, it manifests in the form of **justice**—its **master virtue**. To achieve this, its three fundamental elements—*reason*, *spirit* (or passion), and *appetite* (or desire)—must be performing well and harmoniously. The resulting virtues for achieving these three are the following:
		1. **wisdom -** when reason overrides impulses.
		2. **courage -** when spirit follows and supports reason.
		3. **temperance -** when appetite follows both reason and spirit.
2. State level
	- Plato thinks that the ideal state consists of the following classes:
		1. **rulers**, which would ideally be both a competent leader and knowledgeable in philosophy;
		2. **military**; and
		3. **merchants**, which includes farmers and craftsmen.
	- The classes share the same virtues as the soul’s elements because their primary functions correspond to one another, that is
		1. rulers -> reason;
		2. military -> spirit; and
		3. merchants -> appetite.

> [!SUMMARY]- Summary of Basic Functions and their Corresponding Virtues
>
> | Soul     | State    | Virtue     |
> | -------- | -------- | ---------- |
> | Reason   | Rulers   | Wisdom     |
> | Spirit   | Military | Courage    |
> | Appetite | Merchant | Temperance |

Plato states that a class should not interfere with the functions of another class; doing so, will result in social disharmony, confusion of roles, and increased bias. For example, a ruler taking part in business (a merchant’s function) will turn his ruling decisions more impartial—he will implement policies that favor his business interests. If the classes all harmoniously and excellently perform their functions, like the soul and its elements, they achieve their master virtue, **justice**.

***

Aristotle describes justice as having two levels:

1. General level
	- One can achieve a higher virtue of justice by following all the laws of a state, which, presumably, cultivate all individual [[moral virtues]] (referred to as a **complete virtue**). It is, in this regard, a **system virtue**.
2. Particular level
	- Justice, in a particular sense, pertains to fairness with respect to dealings with other citizens of the state.
	- It is considered an individual virtue because it is on the same level as the individual moral virtues (e.g., patience, modesty, etc.).
	- Aristotle asserts that there are two types of particular justice:
		1. **Distributive justice -** fairness in the distribution of benefits (desirable things) and burdens (undesirable things).
		2. **Corrective justice -** fairness in correcting injustices or in restoring justice.
	- To determine what actions are fair for both types of particular justice, Aristotle developed the *principle of proportionality*.
		- **For distributive justice,** group members should receive benefits/burdens in proportion to their contribution to the success/failure of a group.
		- **For corrective justice,** involves the appropriate punishment/compensation to correct an injustice.
