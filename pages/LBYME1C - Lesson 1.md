- # [[Engineering Design Process]]
	- Engineering Design Processes are approaches engineers use to solve problems. They serve as frameworks for designing under constraints and requirements.
	- ## Types
		- Systematic (i.e., methodical, fixed plan)
		- Iterative (i.e., repeated)
	- ## Steps
		- [[ideation phase|Ideation phase]] (1/3)
			1. Identify the problem or requirement
				- Understand the context, objective, and constraints of the project
			2. Research
				- Gather information related to the problem by reviewing by existing solutions, surveys, or relevant technologies/materials
			3. Brainstorm
			4. Select the best solution by evaluating using a criteria
		- [[development phase|Development phase]] (2/3)
			1. Develop detailed designs
				- Create a detailed design for the selected solutions
				- This process involves creating drawings and prototypes
			2. Build and test prototypes
			3. Analyze and iterate
				- Analyze the results of testing and identify issues or areas of improvement
				- Make revisions to the design and repeat testing if needed
			4. Finalize the design
				- Finalize the design once it passes testing and meets all requirements
				- Prepare a detailed documentation and plans for production/implementation
		- [[implementation phase|Implementation Phase]] (3/3)
			1. Production or implementation
				- Start the construction/implementation based on the final design
				- Coordinate with suppliers, contractors, and production teams
			2. Quality assurance and testing
				- Implement quality control measures to ensure that the final product meets all specifications and standards
				- Conduct rigorous testing to verify performance
			3. Deployment or delivery
				- Deploy the product in its intended environment or deliver it to the end users
			4. Monitor and maintenance
				- Continuously monitor the productâ€™s performance in the real world; implement maintenance and support to ensure long-term reliability and functionality.
			5. Feedback and improvement
				- Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement
