# Introduction
- The actions that we morally judge are those that involve [[moral person|moral persons]]—both doers and receivers of these actions
- A defining characteristic of a moral person is that they are held morally accountable for their actions
- # [[moral personhood|Moral personhood]]
	- We assume that people involved in moral actions are [[moral person|moral persons]] who have [[moral status]]. Moral judgement only apply to actions involving them.
		- Moral persons generally only refer to humans; hence, animals are usually not judged morally—moral doers still get judged when interacting with animals. Nevertheless, it becomes more complicated when discussing humans who are either not sentient or have mental disabilities.
	- ## Moral persons and rights
		- Moral persons are beings with moral status and moral rights; hence, we should be concerned for the rightness or wrongness of how they act or how they are being treated.
		- [[duty|Duties]] are actions we ought to do. Unlike rights, failure to perform them merits a sanction.
			- People have a duty to respect the rights of others
		- ### Rights
			- [[right|Rights]] refer to interests one is allowed to pursue or actions one is allowed to do. Possession of rights implies that others have duties involving those rights—either duties of non-interference or duties of provision.
			- #### Classifications
				- Based on the duties imposed by rights. It can sometimes be either depending on the condition (like if the duties of provision is impossible)
					- [[negative right|Negative rights]] - only involves rights that impose duties of non-interference
					- [[positive right|Positive rights]] - involves rights that impose duties of provision and the duties of non-interference
				- Based on how the rights were acquired
					- [[contractual right|Contractual rights]] - are rights we acquire when we enter into an agreement or a contract. They are either *formal*—when the rights and duties of the parties in the contract are explicitly stated—or *informal*—when the rights and duties are merely implied.
					- [[legal right|Legal rights]] - are rights we acquire when we become a citizen of a particular state.
					- [[moral right|Moral rights]] - are rights we acquire when we become a moral person or a member of a moral community. This entails that moral rights are granted to those exhibiting the defining qualities of moral personhood: [[sentience]] (the capacity to experience pleasure and pain), and [[rationality]] (the capacity to know and choose freely).
						- Human rights refer to the moral rights of humans. Similarly, moral rights involving animals are referred to as animal rights.
						- We judge the morality of legal and contractual rights on the basis of whether they respect or violate moral rights.
	- ## Moral agents and patients
		- Moral persons can be categorized as [[moral agent|moral agents]] or [[moral patient|moral patients]]
		- Moral agents perform morally evaluable actions because it is their moral duty
		- Moral patients receive morally evaluable actions because it is their moral right
		- All moral persons are moral patients but not all of them are moral agents (everyone has moral rights but not moral duties). In order to be a moral agent, one must have the capacity to make informed decisions
			- A [[non-agentive moral person]] pertains to a moral person who cannot be a moral agent. Consequently, a moral person who can is referred to as a [[agentive moral person]].
			- Only agentive moral persons can be held accountable for their actions; however, other conditions must also be satisfied before a moral agent can be held accountable for their actions
	- ## Criteria for moral personhood
		- Views about the criteria by which entities are regarded as moral persons are known as [[theories of personhood]]
			- Theories involving the identification of a criteria are called [[criterial theories of personhood]]
			- Theories involving the qualifying nature of a criterion is known as [[meta-criterial theories of personhood]]
		- ### Uni-criterial theories
			- Assumes that there is only one quality that sufficiently defines moral personhood
			- The [[genetic theory]] argues that only humans are moral persons. It gives rise to the question of why homo sapiens morally value their genetic uniqueness. Critics say that the baseless denial of personhood to non-humans is a discriminatory form of [[speciesism]].
			- The [[life theory]] claims that personhood is defined by the possession of life. In its extreme version, it also includes insects and micro-organisms. As a result, it is criticized for being impractical.
			- The [[rational theory]] contends that [[rationality]]—the capacity to act freely and reason—is what defines personhood. It is criticized for excluding beings without rationality (mentally challenged humans, comatose patients, and etc.)
			- The [[sentient theory]] argues that the defining feature of personhood is [[sentience]]—the capacity to feel pain and pleasure. It is criticized for excluding people who lost their capacity for sentience, like paralyzed humans. In addition, it is criticized for not being able to justify why we should care about preserving ecological systems. Lastly, it is criticized for prioritizing animals who have higher sentience than humans (especially those who have lost it due to specific conditions).
			- The [[relational theory]] contends that the defining feature of personhood is relationships. It is, however, usually limited to human relationships only. Nevertheless, it can be extended to animals and plants. The theory is criticized for entailing that only people part of the/a caring relationships have value. Lastly, it also entails non-living objects can also be objects of moral consideration depending on who cares for them.
		- ### Multi-criterial theories
			- Assumes that a combination of more than one qualities is what is sufficient to define moral personhood (usually a combination of uni-criterial theories). It can be understood in two ways:
				- conjunctively, [[conjunctive construal]], or strict interpretation, requires that all characteristics are present to be qualified as a person. It is criticized for being counter-productive at times by being too exclusive.
				- disjunctively, [[disjunctive construal]], or liberal interpretation, requires that at least one characteristic is present to be qualified as a person. It is criticized for being too inclusive; for instance, by potentially including micro-organisms to the moral community.
			- For the purposes of this course, only the three should be considered: [[rationality]], [[sentience]], and [[relationality]]. This is so that we can understand the three dominant ethical theories.
			- The [[cognitive theory of personhood]] contends that an entity is only considered a person when they exhibit the following qualities: consciousness, reasoning, self-motivated activity, communication, and self-concept and self-awareness. This theory combines the [[sentient theory|sentient]] and [[rational theory]] of personhood.
