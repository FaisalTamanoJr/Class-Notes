# Introduction
- The actions that we morally judge are those that involve [[moral person|moral persons]]—both doers and receivers of these actions
- A defining characteristic of a moral person is that they are held morally accountable for their actions
- # [[moral personhood|Moral personhood]]
	- We assume that people involved in moral actions are [[moral person|moral persons]] who have [[moral status]]. Moral judgement only apply to actions involving them.
		- Moral persons generally only refer to humans; hence, animals are usually not judged morally—moral doers still get judged when interacting with animals. Nevertheless, it becomes more complicated when discussing humans who are either not sentient or have mental disabilities.
	- ## Moral persons and rights
		- Moral persons are beings with moral status and moral rights; hence, we should be concerned for the rightness or wrongness of how they act or how they are being treated.
		- [[duty|Duties]] are actions we ought to do. Unlike rights, failure to perform them merits a sanction.
			- People have a duty to respect the rights of others
		- ### Rights
			- [[right|Rights]] refer to interests one is allowed to pursue or actions one is allowed to do. Possession of rights implies that others have duties involving those rights—either duties of non-interference or duties of provision.
			- #### Classifications
				- Based on the duties imposed by rights. It can sometimes be either depending on the condition (like if the duties of provision is impossible)
					- [[negative right|Negative rights]] - only involves rights that impose duties of non-interference
					- [[positive right|Positive rights]] - involves rights that impose duties of provision and the duties of non-interference
				- Based on how the rights were acquired
					- [[contractual right|Contractual rights]] - are rights we acquire when we enter into an agreement or a contract. They are either *formal*—when the rights and duties of the parties in the contract are explicitly stated—or *informal*—when the rights and duties are merely implied.
					- [[legal right|Legal rights]] - are rights we acquire when we become a citizen of a particular state.
					- [[moral right|Moral rights]] - are rights we acquire when we become a moral person or a member of a moral community. This entails that moral rights are granted to those exhibiting the defining qualities of moral personhood: [[sentience]] (the capacity to experience pleasure and pain), and [[rationality]] (the capacity to know and choose freely).
						- Human rights refer to the moral rights of humans. Similarly, moral rights involving animals are referred to as animal rights.
						- We judge the morality of legal and contractual rights on the basis of whether they respect or violate moral rights.
	- ## Moral agents and patients
		- Moral persons can be categorized as [[moral agent|moral agents]] or [[moral patient|moral patients]]
		- Moral agents perform morally evaluable actions because it is their moral duty
		- Moral patients receive morally evaluable actions because it is their moral right
