# Introduction
- The actions that we morally judge are those that involve [[moral person|moral persons]]—both doers and receivers of these actions
- A defining characteristic of a moral person is that they are held morally accountable for their actions
- # [[moral personhood|Moral personhood]]
	- We assume that people involved in moral actions are [[moral person|moral persons]] who have [[moral status]]. Moral judgement only apply to actions involving them.
		- Moral persons generally only refer to humans; hence, animals are usually not judged morally—moral doers still get judged when interacting with animals. Nevertheless, it becomes more complicated when discussing humans who are either not sentient or have mental disabilities.
	- ## Moral persons and rights
		- Moral persons are beings with moral status and moral rights; hence, we should be concerned for the rightness or wrongness of how they act or how they are being treated.
		- [[duty|Duties]] are actions we ought to do. Unlike rights, failure to perform them merits a sanction.
			- People have a duty to respect the rights of others
		- ### Rights
			- [[right|Rights]] refer to interests one is allowed to pursue or actions one is allowed to do. Possession of rights implies that others have duties involving those rights—either duties of non-interference or duties of provision.
			- #### Classifications
				- Based on the duties imposed by rights. It can sometimes be either depending on the condition (like if the duties of provision is impossible)
					- [[negative right|Negative rights]] - only involves rights that impose duties of non-interference
					- [[positive right|Positive rights]] - involves rights that impose duties of provision and the duties of non-interference
				- Based on how the rights were acquired
					- [[contractual right|Contractual rights]] - are rights we acquire when we enter into an agreement or a contract. They are either *formal*—when the rights and duties of the parties in the contract are explicitly stated—or *informal*—when the rights and duties are merely implied.
					- [[legal right|Legal rights]] - are rights we acquire when we become a citizen of a particular state.
					- [[moral right|Moral rights]] - are rights we acquire when we become a moral person or a member of a moral community. This entails that moral rights are granted to those exhibiting the defining qualities of moral personhood: [[sentience]] (the capacity to experience pleasure and pain), and [[rationality]] (the capacity to know and choose freely).
						- Human rights refer to the moral rights of humans. Similarly, moral rights involving animals are referred to as animal rights.
						- We judge the morality of legal and contractual rights on the basis of whether they respect or violate moral rights.
	- ## Moral agents and patients
		- Moral persons can be categorized as [[moral agent|moral agents]] or [[moral patient|moral patients]]
		- Moral agents perform morally evaluable actions because it is their moral duty
		- Moral patients receive morally evaluable actions because it is their moral right
		- All moral persons are moral patients but not all of them are moral agents (everyone has moral rights but not moral duties). In order to be a moral agent, one must have the capacity to make informed decisions
			- A [[non-agentive moral person]] pertains to a moral person who cannot be a moral agent. Consequently, a moral person who can is referred to as a [[agentive moral person]].
			- Only agentive moral persons can be held accountable for their actions; however, other conditions must also be satisfied before a moral agent can be held accountable for their actions
	- ## Criteria for moral personhood
		- Views about the criteria by which entities are regarded as moral persons are known as [[theories of personhood]]
			- Theories involving the identification of a criteria are called [[criterial theories of personhood]]
			- Theories involving the qualifying nature of a criterion is known as [[meta-criterial theories of personhood]]
		- ### Uni-criterial theories
			- Assumes that there is only one quality that sufficiently defines moral personhood
			- The [[genetic theory of personhood]] argues that only humans are moral persons. It gives rise to the question of why homo sapiens morally value their genetic uniqueness. Critics say that the baseless denial of personhood to non-humans is a discriminatory form of [[speciesism]].
			- The [[life theory of personhood]] claims that personhood is defined by the possession of life. In its extreme version, it also includes insects and micro-organisms. As a result, it is criticized for being impractical.
			- The [[rational theory of personhood]] contends that [[rationality]]—the capacity to act freely and reason—is what defines personhood. It is criticized for excluding beings without rationality (mentally challenged humans, comatose patients, and etc.)
			- The [[sentient theory of personhood]] argues that the defining feature of personhood is [[sentience]]—the capacity to feel pain and pleasure. It is criticized for excluding people who lost their capacity for sentience, like paralyzed humans. In addition, it is criticized for not being able to justify why we should care about preserving ecological systems. Lastly, it is criticized for prioritizing animals who have higher sentience than humans (especially those who have lost it due to specific conditions).
			- The [[relational theory of personhood]] contends that the defining feature of personhood is relationships. It is, however, usually limited to human relationships only. Nevertheless, it can be extended to animals and plants. The theory is criticized for entailing that only people part of the/a caring relationships have value. Lastly, it also entails non-living objects can also be objects of moral consideration depending on who cares for them.
		- ### Multi-criterial theories
			- Assumes that a combination of more than one qualities is what is sufficient to define moral personhood (usually a combination of uni-criterial theories). It can be understood in two ways:
				- conjunctively, [[conjunctive construal]], or strict interpretation, requires that all characteristics are present to be qualified as a person. It is criticized for being counter-productive at times by being too exclusive.
				- disjunctively, [[disjunctive construal]], or liberal interpretation, requires that at least one characteristic is present to be qualified as a person. It is criticized for being too inclusive; for instance, by potentially including micro-organisms to the moral community.
			- The [[cognitive theory of personhood]] contends that an entity is only considered a person when they exhibit the following qualities: consciousness, reasoning, self-motivated activity, communication, and self-concept and self-awareness. This theory combines the [[sentient theory of personhood|sentient]] and [[rational theory of personhood|rational]] theory of personhood.
			- For the purposes of this course, only the three should be considered (in the liberal interpretation of it): [[rationality]], [[sentience]], and [[relationality]]. This is so that we can understand the three dominant ethical theories.
		- ### Meta-criterial theories
			- Instead of identifying the criteria for determining if a being is a moral person or not, they are qualified with regards to their mode of existence and attribution. There are two prominent theories of this type:
				- [[social theory of personhood]] - states that personhood is a social construct, a mere creation of society, since the accepted criteria hinges on the formed social agreement.
				- [[gradient theory of personhood]] - claims that personhood varies in degrees because moral persons possess the defining traits of personhood in varying degrees too.
			- The two prominent meta-criterial theories have been criticized for being a potential means for justifying inhumane treatment of certain groups.
- # [[moral accountability|Moral accountability]]
	- [[moral agent|Moral agents]] are held accountable for their moral actions towards [[moral patient|moral patients]]. This concept ties [[moral personhood]] to moral accountability.
	- ## Accountability and responsibility
		- [[accountability|Accountability]] refers to the deservingness of punishment or reward based on the rightness of our actions. It is a product of our [[rationality]] because it allows us to distinguish right from wrong.
		- Just because someone deserves a punishment or reward does not mean that they actually get the punishment or reward they deserve.
			- Kant believes that the goal of morality is the deservingness of happiness, not really happiness. Accountability is similar in a way that someone may deserve a treatment, but actually do not receive it.
		- In philosophy, a person is usually referred to as an [[agent]], as opposed to inanimate objects who are known as [[cause|causes]]. Being an agent is a necessary precondition for accountability.
			- An agent being a precondition for accountability does not imply that, by being responsible for an action, you should be held morally accountable for it (just that you *can* be). This is because there are also other conditions that must be satisfied before holding someone accountable for a particular action. In this context, [[responsibility]] refers to the cause of the action.
			- Responsibility can also refer to the possession duties or obligations that gives rise to accountability. This is also known as [[prospective responsibility]], referring to the responsibility directed towards actions that will or may happen.
			- On the other hand, [[retrospective responsibility]] deals with responsibility directed towards actions that had already happened, which people often interchange with accountability.
	- ## Moral and legal accountability
		- There are different types of accountability; one way of distinguishing them is by focusing on the standards used to evaluate the quality (rightness or wrongness) of an action—moral accountability uses moral standards while legal accountability uses legal standards..
		- Legal sanctions involve external (physical) forms of punishment while moral sanctions involve internal (or mental) forms of punishment.
	- ## Conditions for moral accountability
		- The conditions for moral accountability can be classified into [[attribution conditions]] (also known as [[assignment conditions]]) or [[degree conditions]].
		- ### The attribution conditions
			- These deal with the attribution of accountability to a person for a certain action they committed. Under these are the following:
				- [[incriminating conditions|Incriminating conditions]]
					- Involves making an agent morally accountable for a certain action under consideration. If one of the conditions are not satisfied, then they are excused from moral accountability.
					- [[knowledge condition|Knowledge condition]] is an incriminating condition that refers to the capacity of a person to know the moral quality of a certain action
					- [[intentionality condition|Intentionality condition]] is an incriminating condition that refers to whether the action under consideration was intentional or unintentional
				- [[excusing conditions|Excusing conditions]]
					- Involves sparing an agent from being held morally accountable for a certain action.
					- [[ignorance|Ignorance]] refers to the occurrence when the knowledge condition fails to be satisfied
					- [[involuntariness|Involuntariness]] refers to the occurrence  when the intentionality condition fails to be satisfied
		- ### The degree conditions
			- These conditions deal with the degree of an agent’s accountability. Under these are the following:
				- [[mitigating conditions|Mitigating conditions]]
					- Conditions are classified as mitigating when they lessen the degree of one’s moral accountability
				- [[aggravating condition|Aggravating conditions]]
					- Conditions are classified as aggravating when they increase the degree of one’s moral accountability
