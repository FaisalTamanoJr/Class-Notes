		- Represents the system concept using data models.
	- Object-oriented methodologies
		- Is the balance or combination of data-centered and process-centered methodologies.
- [[waterfall model|Waterfall model| or development]]
	- The phases are sequentially ordered.
	- Advantages
		- System requirements are known in advanced.
		- Changes in requirements are minimal.
		- Good for managing projects and results to solid systems.
	- Disadvantages
		- Design must be completely specified before programming begins.
		- Difficult to accommodate changes.
- [[Parallel development]]
	- Attempts to address the long interval between the analysis phase and the delivery…
- [[Rapid Application Development]] (RAD)
	- A general strategy to adjust the SDLC phases, and deliver the system quickly to the users. It utilizes special techniques and computer tools in order to do this.
	- Five key factors
		1. Extensive user involvement
		2. Joint Application Design sessions
		3. Prototyping
		4. Integrated CASE tools
		5. Code generators
	- Goals
		- To rapidly analyze a business process.
		- To design a viable system solution through intense cooperation between users and developers.
- [[Joint Application Development]] (JAD)
	- Replaces a series of interviews with a user community in order to collect system requirements from key people. This helps in analyzing the existing system, while gathering the expectations from users and documenting the user requirements for the new system.
