# Class-notes

Visit [[contents]] to view the contents of the vault.

The flashcards I use are found in this [repository](https://github.com/FaisalTamanoJr/Anki-Class-Flashcards).

## How to access the notes

1. Clone the repository.
2. Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download).
3. Open a vault.
4. Select the cloned repository directory.
5. Trust the author of the vault, and enable the community plugins.

## Updating the notes

1. Open the terminal/PowerShell at the cloned repository’s folder.
	- In windows, you can do this by opening the folder in file explorer, right clicking, and clicking “open PowerShell/terminal window here”.
2. Enter `git pull` (make sure you have [git](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads) installed).
	- If you encounter an error relating to local changes, enter these commands
		1. `git fetch origin master`
		2. `git reset --hard origin/master`

Note: This only works if you cloned the repository with git to download the files. Although you get a much smaller file size when downloading through zip, you can only update it by downloading the zip file again.

## Limitations

- Inconsistent point-of-view
	- Fluctuations between the use of first, second, and third person point-of-view occur
- Inconsistent use of grammatical tenses
	- Fluctuations between the use of past, present, and future tense occur
- Inconsistent styling/formatting
	- Over time, there have been changes in the ways the notes have been written; however, those changes were not applied to older notes.
- Vulnerability to misinterpretations
