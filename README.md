# Class-notes

Because I frequently have been asked for my notes in class, I've decided to start uploading them in this repository.

Keep in mind that my notes are not meant to be a comprehensive resource that can function as a replacement to the textbooks. It will mostly just be used for reviewing, or for helping me understand specific topics. Details that I am already very familiar with, or information that I can easily recall or understand, are usually ignored.
