# Class-notes
Because I frequently have been asked for my notes in class, I've decided to start uploading them in this repository.

## How to access the notes
1. Clone the repository.
2. Download [Logseq](https://logseq.com/).
3. Open the application and add a new graph.
4. Select the cloned repository directory.

## Updating the notes
1. Open the command line at the cloned repository's folder.
2. Type "git pull"

(this repository will remain empty until my 5th term)
