# Class-notes

Because I frequently have been asked for my notes in class, I've decided to start uploading them in this repository.

Visit [[contents]] to view the contents of the vault.

## How to access the notes

1. Clone the repository.
2. Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download).
3. Open a vault.
4. Select the cloned repository directory.
5. Trust the author of the vault, and enable the community plugins.

## Updating the notes

1. Open the command line at the cloned repository's folder.
2. Type "git pull".
