- [[ecology|Ecology]]
	- The study of interactions between different organisms, and between organisms and their surroundings.
	- Levels of ecological organization
		- [[species|Species]]
			- Refer to all organisms that can reproduce.
		- [[populations|Populations]]
			- The organisms of the same species living in the same place and at the same time.
		- [[community|Community]]
			- Several interacting populations occupying the same habitat.
		- [[ecosphere|Ecosphere]]
			- The entirety of Earth’s ecosystems.
- [[ecosystem|Ecosystem]]
	- The organisms living in an area and the non-living features of their environment, including the interactions that exist within.
	- They vary in complexity, not delineated by sharp boundaries, merge with one another.
	- Major components
		- [[biotic|Biotic]]
			- The biological environment that consists of
				- plants
				- animals
				- microorganisms
				- fungi
			- Components
				- [[producers|Producers]]
					- Plants (autotrophs) - produce their own food from inorganic compounds via photosynthesis.
				- [[consumers|Consumers]]
					- Organisms (heterotrophs) - can only acquire food from other organisms, by feeding on plants or other organisms.
					- Herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores.
					- Classifications
						- Primary consumers - herbivores.
						- Secondary consumers - feed on primary consumers.
						- Tertiary consumers - feed on secondary consumers.
				- [[decomposers|Decomposers]]
					- Breaks down the remains of dead animals and plants, releasing substances that can be used by other members of the ecosystem.
		- [[abiotic|Abiotic]]
			- The physical and chemical environment that consists of
				- water
				- air
				- nutrients
				- solar energy
- [[biosphere|Biosphere]]
	- The part of earth that supports life.
		- Top portion of the crust
		- Water bodies
		- Atmosphere
- Earth’s life support system
	- Is a closed system where all materials are repeatedly recycled. The only contributing part from the outside is the Sun.
	- [[atmosphere|Atmosphere]]
		- A thin layer of gases that surround the Earth. It is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, 0.03% carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of other gases.
	- [[hydrosphere|Hydrosphere]]
		- The water portion of Earth that covers nearly 71% of its surface.
	- [[lithosphere|Lithosphere]]
		- Is divided into three principal regions: core, mantle, and the crust. Two of its principal divisions are the continents and the ocean basins.
- [[biomes|Biomes]]
	- A distinct ecological community of plants and animals living together in a particular climate.
	- The broad terrestrial regions of the biosphere.
	- [[climate|Climate]]
		- The weather over the long term that determines the type of life forms in the biomes.
		- Its most important factors are [[precipitation|Precipitation]] and [[temperature]].
- Interaction among organisms
	- Predation
		- A form of population control where an organism kills another organism for food.
	- Commensalism
		- An interaction where it is beneficial to one but neutral to another.
	- Mutualism
		- Benefits both organisms.
	- Parasitism
		- One species lives on or even inside their host.
	- Competition
		- Two organisms compete for the same resource.
- Food chains and food webs
	- A way to allow nutrients and energy to flow through an ecosystem.
	- [[food chain|Food Chain]] - feeding of one organism upon another in a sequence of food transfers.
		- Types
			- [[grazer|Grazer]] - starts with plants.
			- [[decomposer|Decomposer]] - organic waste material (detritus) is the major food source.
	- [[food web|Food Web]] - a set of interconnected food chains by which energy and materials circulate within an ecosystem. All plants and animals are part of this complex food web.
- Matter cycling
