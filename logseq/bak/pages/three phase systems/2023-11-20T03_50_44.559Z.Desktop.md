alias:: three waveforms

- Definition
	- An integration of three [[single phase systems]] to form a delta or a wye.
	- A 3-phase source can be connected to a 3-phase load.
		- Because both systems have 3 terminals, we would need 3 wires or a *3-phase transmission line*.
- Possible Configurations
	- Wye Source - Delta Load
	- Wye Source - Wye Load
	- Delta Source - Wye Source
	- Delta Source - Delta Load
- Parameters
	- Phase Voltage
	- Line Voltage
	- Line Current (connecting the source and the load)
	- Load Current
	- Load Voltage
- Wye Sources
	- Have four terminals:
		- a
		- b
		- c
		- neutral, or the center where all terminals are connected to.
- Delta Sources
	- Have three terminals:
		- a
		- b
		- c
